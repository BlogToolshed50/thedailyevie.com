Vermiculture is an easy way to the rearing of the Earth worms. This was going on as a natural process since the birth of the Earth. Now it is undertaken consciously with a view to nurture and save the soil from deterioration. Earth worms are grown in controlled climatic conditions and let out into the soil of inferior quality. They enrich the soil by converting the soil eaten by them into a nutritionally rich mass. Many countries are now entering into this field to improve the soil wealth.
