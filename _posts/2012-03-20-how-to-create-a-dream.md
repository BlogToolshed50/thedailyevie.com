All of us have a vision of our own possibility. Yet few achieve the success that our heart&#8217;s desire.

For us to move closer to our dream of health and wealth and achievement, we first need to move beyond the angst of our memories of past failures. We must move beyond our hesitation and our fears. And we must put behind us the memory of what it was like to walk along the boulevard of broken dreams.

We also must realize that greatness is not easy.

In an inspired moment, we may make enormous progress, but, sooner or later, we come up against the boundary of our world-view, our choice of circumstances, and we do not know how to move beyond it.

The world we live in now is one that we created from what we knew before.

A dream, however, calls for us to expand, to move beyond experience, and even to move beyond our knowledge of how things work.

It is beyond the invisible boundary of the world that we have made that our dream awaits us, beckoning us to step into the unknown.

Dreams test us. They goad and prompt us, but they also test us. How much are we willing to give up for them? How long are we willing to act in the face of discouraging circumstances?

When something new is being created in our reality, we often feel lost and afraid. It takes enormous courage to journey into uncharted terrain.

In addition, there is a lag time between our inner change and the manifestation of the dream, and during that lag time we must live in the midst of old effects. It takes an intense desire and hidden fire to believe in the evidence of things not seen. Too often the evidence of our current environment completely intimidates us&#8230;and we surrender to the belief that our current limitations are real and inevitable.

Yet the world that seems so solid is actually elastic.

When our consciousness of what is possible for us changes, then the world, too, shifts away from its familiar moorings and offers us a chance to be more of whom we believe ourselves to be.

If we can hold fast to our goals and take action relentlessly, we will discover a key to success that yields abundance in every area of our lives.

Consider what it will cost us, in the long run, if we turn away from our own promise.
