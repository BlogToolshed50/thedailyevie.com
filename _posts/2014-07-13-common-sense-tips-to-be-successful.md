We are all looking for a way to make life better but what it comes down to is looking at what others are doing and trying to model your efforts after what’s already being done. Success is not about recreating the wheel… it’s all about “little” modification with your own personality on it… isn’t that what everyone talks about anyway… it’s never about the newest thing that makes anyone successful… it’s all about small changes or improvements that we make that makes things what they are.

Tip 1: Keep it simple; watch others… I can’t reiterate enough how important it is to look at what others are doing.

Tip 2: Set goals for yourself… if you don’t know where you want to go do you honestly think your lazy but is ever going to get there ?

Tip 3: Action Plan…. You already know what your goals are, do you have benchmarks set so that you know what you’re going to do every step of the way. Anyone can write “my 30 days to success” so chart out what you’re going to do day by day to get there… because goals are only a piece of the puzzle. Most importantly “Don’t rush to get there”.

Tip 4: Listen…. Oh my god… what a concept.. half of us trying to get somewhere want to tell someone who’s already there how to do what they are already doing right ! If you spend all your time talking then you’re never going to hear the message you need to hear to get to where you want to be.

Tip 5: Stay current…. If you’re so conservative about things just staying the way they’ve always been…. honestly I don’t know how successful you really want to be.

Tip 6: Talk about success… the most successful people talk and breathe it all day long. If you’re all about the negative then guess what you’re bound to stay right behind the front door while the rest of the world is actually “doing something”.

Tip 7: Motivation… Figure out what is going to motivate you to “be successful”. For some of us it’s “things” and for others it may be your children so do a little sitting and write down what’s going to motivate you.

Tip 8: Keep it Real… Money is a vehicle in this society and we need it to keep things moving, but DON’T PUT IT FIRST.. however be real with yourself about the importance of money in society and in your life.. not only for you and your piece of mind but for what you want your children to be able to accomplish in life as well. No one wants to say it but money really is important and it certainly gives us all piece of mind.

Tip 9: Patience… Success is NOT overnight; success is “progressive” with many avenues to it and as it’s been stated before “Don’t Rush” as that alone can kill the work and time that you’ve invested into it. Be patient and the fruits of your labor will come. If you work hard in your lifetime you’ll always have something positive to show for it.

Tip 10: The Epiphany… You don’t know what you don’t know until you know what you don’t know. So get out there and learn so you can join the rest of the successful people out there.

Good Luck!
