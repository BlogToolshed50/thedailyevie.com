This guest post from Mickey Garza

I have always wanted to have a big and extravagant wedding. I knew by the age of sixteen some of the things that I wanted to have in my wedding. I had the flowers planned, music, and decorations. What I did not understand at that time is how much work that actually goes into a wedding. It is a great deal that goes into having a wedding that I had no idea about. I knew that I would have to do a fair amount of research in order for me not to have to spend all my money on the wedding. So I used the hughsnet at my home and job to research all kinds of things. Utilizing the internet took a great deal of stress off of me because I was able to get the contact information and pricing information that I needed within minutes. I had one of the best weddings that I have ever seen and I still had some money to spare. It was the happiest day of my life.
