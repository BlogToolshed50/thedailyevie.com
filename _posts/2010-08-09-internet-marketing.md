Which of the following statements about Affiliate Marketing describe where you are?

1. You know what Affiliate Marketing is.
  
2. You understand that Affiliate Marketing can produce a good income for you.
  
3. You believe in your ability to make money selling other people’s stuff on the internet.
  
4. You’re not exactly sure of what you should do first, where you should invest your money or how to move from learning to earning.

If this is where you’re at, you’re not alone. Every day, thousands of people launch into Affiliate Marketing in exactly the same place; ready to give it an honest try and ready to see results. 

The truth is that for every thousand people who give Affiliate Marketing a try, only a handful will actually succeed in making any real money. Who makes it? Who doesn’t, and what is the magic difference?

The answers are going to surprise you. They definitely surprised me.

The “gurus” of Affiliate Marketing, like all business success stories, were the first to discover and fully harness the incredible money making opportunities available. Today’s “market of affiliate marketing” is crowded and competitive. You will work harder and longer today to make a fraction of what many made “overnight” when the business was young.
