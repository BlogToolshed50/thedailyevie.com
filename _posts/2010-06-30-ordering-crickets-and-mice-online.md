Thanks to my buddy Daniel Piercy for the post.

I keep many different reptiles at home. Mostly exotic species such as some extremely large pythons and a few gigantic monitor lizards. My friends can attest to the fact my house resembles a miniature zoo most of the time. If I added a little bit of sound effects and a lot of plants I could even give it a jungle theme. By getting online using hughes broadband internet, I am able to significantly cut my monthly food costs for all the animals. It is extremely convenient ordering crickets and meal worms online- especially since I order in bulk. And by bulk I mean several thousand insects at a time. They always get to my house really quick, and I don&#8217;t have to leave the house to purchase them. The only drawback to purchasing animal food online is the fact some of it arrives in very bulky packages. For instance, when I have to order large quantities of frozen rats and rabbits I can expect to pay for several pounds alone in dry ice to preserve them. I&#8217;m sure my neighbor&#8217;s wonder what I could possibly be getting twice a month from FedEx. The amount of money I save is definitely worth it in the end though. I would pay almost triple the amount I do if I actually went into pet store and made my orders in person.
