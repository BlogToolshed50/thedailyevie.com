&#8220;The face is the basis of all identities of a human being. Itâ€™s a thing that belongs to you but others use it to identify you. You foster your emotions through your face. You see the world and the world sees you through your face. We can never imagine a person without a face because then, you do not have an identity or a canvas to portray your words and yourself. With all those phrases about the face, we all can imagine and realize the power of it. How one can actually use it as a canvas to put up or show some of the most magnificent beauties of nature or humans or to defend a cause or issue of global concern. We can use our face to put up many silent words and feelings through face painting. By painting your face about the thing, you want to show or protest about, you can grab attention better than any other media because humans are visual creatures. Our sense of vision influences us the most.

Some of the most famous face painting designs are:

Baby Tiger, Butterfly Multi-Color, Camouflage, Cat, Cheetah, Dragon, Fantasy Alien, Flower Princess, Jewel Princess and Lion

Here are a few tips for face painting:

Tip 1: Buy and use your face judiciously. Keep them at a safe place away from toddlers and infants. Check out the tubs or sticks form for paints.

Tip 2: When you are putting a base color or coloring a large area use a sponge rather than a brush. It will be quicker and will give a good special effect.

Tip 3: Be patient and let the fresh layer of color you have applied, dry off. And be miser when applying the color layers, as thick layers will crack on drying.

Tip 4: If you are not sure enough about a design, use a stencil. This will make you more confident.

Tip 5: Visualize well about what you are going to paint in advance. It will save time and errors too.

Tip 6: Have many tissues handy while painting. Also, keep a good chair or stool for the one whose face is to be paint for stability. Keep a mirror to show the results to that person.

Tip 7: the paint you have put on the face acts like natural glue. You can dust or paste glitters on it when it is partially dry, or stick a cotton swab on the face. Dip a tissue in color and cover the swab. Then give it the finishing touch. It is ideal for bushy eyebrows or a big cartoon king of nose. You can use artificial jewels for a bejeweled look of a fairy or princess/prince.
