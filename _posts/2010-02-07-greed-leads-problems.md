Greed leads to all the drudgery a person undergoes. The Mother-earth, as rightly said by Mahatma Gandhi has given all that the human kind need, but not to meet out their greed. It is this education that one should undergo in the childhood to avoid the resultant problems and various troubles he has to undergo at the latter part of the life. Indeed, the greed towards material life keeps away the person to enjoy the life in an ethical way for which the Human race is created by God in the Universe.
