• Keep the lens clean with a soft cloth

• Don’t store it in dirty or dusty places

• Don’t leave the camera in direct sun light

• Avoid scratching any part of the camera.

• Always keep dust cap on lenses if they are not being used.

• Never use Paper towels, paper napkins to clean the camera, this can scratch the lenses.

• If your digital camera needs extensive cleaning, take it to a local camera shop.

• If your camera won’t be used for a long time, the batteries and the memory card should be removed.

• Do keep your camera dry. If condensation forms on it, take the memory card out as this can cause internal problems

• When needed, wipe the lens with a few drops of lens cleaning fluid to remove stubborn dirt

• Buy a soft padded camera case to carry around your digital camera. This will protect it from most hard knocks and falls.

• If you have more than two lenses that you use, it maybe worth while to buy a portable bag or carry case to keep safe the camera and optics

The best cloth to use to clean a camera is a micro fiber cloth. You can also use lens tissue made especially for cameras.

Another way of removing dust and grit from a camera lens or filter is to use C02/compressed air; a quick blast of it should dislodge most dust particles from the lens.
