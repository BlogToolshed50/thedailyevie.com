Most of us may not have swimming pool in our back yard, so it’s obvious that when we go out for a vacation it’s a rare treat to splash about in the toasty warm water of an outdoor swimming pool. Outdoor pools are most excellent place enjoyed in the sunshine, and to that end, there could be no better place to lie back in the crystal clear waters, staring at the dappled silhouette of a amazing swaying palm tree and let your cares float away, than in everybody&#8217;s preferred holiday destination, Florida.

It is not necessary that every hotel would have a pool. If in case you choose to stay in the private luxury villa, which has pool you would most definitely be spoil with not only stunning accommodation but also with your own private pool. However, with all things watery, our common sense should be applied. This in itself is not a harmful thing, except maybe when it comes to pool safety.

Fortunately, Florida state law has stepped up in to lend an assistance hand by requiring rental villas with private pools to follow some very basic rules to make sure the well being and safety of their guests. Naturally, children are always be supervised by an adult in and around the pool area. But in addition to that, you would find that your rental villa&#8217;s pool is also obviously marked in terms of water depth, stating both the shallow and deep ends.

Child alert pool alarms are very necessary to be fixed onto any door leading directly from the property into the pool area. This alarm would scream out if opened by a kid to alert parents of the imminent danger. A clear set of &#8220;Pool Rules&#8221; would also be stated at the poolside that you should read carefully before dipping your toes into the water.

Flotation devices such as water wings and inflatable rings are much admired with children, but it must always be remembered that these are not actually life saving devices. They are just floating toys. Just because your kid is wearing water wings, it does not mean that it is secure to leave them to play in or by the pool. Rough play and running on the pool floor is also a big &#8220;No No&#8221;, due to the clear dangers of slipping and diving is also dejected, as most pools only have a maximum depth of 6 foot.

To sum up, if treated with esteem, and common sense is used, your vacation swimming pool could be one of the highlights of your trip. Remember that small children learn by example, so if you as an adult could teach them to safely get pleasure from their swimming experience, it would be a lesson that would never be forgotten, and which eventually could one day save their lives.
