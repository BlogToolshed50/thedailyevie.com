Food security has become more essential for all the nations. When we are facing lots of climatic changes resulting in poor rains in various parts of the globe coupled with the flooding elsewhere, the topic assumes greater significance. Though the modern technologies have increased the quantum output of various agricultural produces, the inherent harmful effects are also observed due to the usage of excessive chemicals.

Here comes the importance of the &#8220;Organic farming&#8221;. Usage of certain organic fertilizers and biological inputs, the production level has gone up along with the healthy produces for a better human life.

Recently it is proven that the usage of the Organic Fulvic acid obtained from natural environment helps the farmers to increase the crop production by 30%. These organic acid is able to detoxify the soil by eliminating the heavy metals and various other toxic elements.

The purest source of such Fulvic Acid is the land source created out of the lush green rainforest that was pushed down below due to the glaciers some 40 million years ago. The humid deposits found from such rainforest decay offers the purest form of Fulvic acid which contains the Amino acids.

Though is our desire to have quantum leap in the food production to meet the demand, it is a must that we follow the right means to get the food materials that are suitable for healthy life of the human being.
