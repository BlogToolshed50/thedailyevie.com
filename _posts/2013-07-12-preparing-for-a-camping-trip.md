Camping can be a wonderful experience away from it all, or a miserable confrontation with nature. When you ask people what they think about camping, you are likely to hear one of two answers—either they love it, or they hate it. It doesn’t take long to form an opinion about an experience in nature, so it is important to be adequately prepared ahead of time.

For those who are new to camping, a few simple tips can make a big difference. An enjoyable experience depends largely on the preparation made for the trip. The amount and kinds of supplies that are needed to be comfortable will vary depending on individual needs. The important thing is to understand what your personal needs are and to plan accordingly for the supplies and equipment you will need.

[Planning] One of the most important aspects of a successful camping trip is planning. Planning a camping trip is not difficult, but it should not be neglected. A systematic approach to planning can help to assure that you will get the campsite you want, and that you will have everything you need for a fun time.

Plan as many activities as you can. Look for hiking trails, streams, and waterfalls that may be identified from your maps and information. Bring games and sporting activities that your children enjoy. If time permits, also consider sightseeing opportunities that are nearby.

Be sure to get good maps and information about your campsite. Get driving directions from an online map service and have another map available when possible. Call your specific campground for maps and specific information about the geography of the area.

Meals &#8211; Consult with everyone you will be camping with about what types of meals are desired. Try to come to agreement on meals, but try to allow everyone to have something they specifically enjoy. Make a schedule of all of the meals and a checklist of the ingredients required for them. Use the checklist to purchase the meals and to be sure that all of the items are loaded before heading off on the trip.

Organization &#8211; Being organized makes camping much more pleasant. It is difficult to have fun while you are constantly fumbling through disorganized piles of supplies and equipment. Use large plastic containers to organize your supplies. These can also be used to store the items at home.

Checklist of Supplies &#8211; A checklist of all the supplies you need for camping can make the difference between a great camping trip and a mediocre one. Make your list as thorough and complete as possible. The checklist helps you to make certain that all of your supplies go with you on your trip. It also helps you to replenish the supplies that have been used up on your trip when you return. If you don’t use a checklist, you will likely find yourself missing items that would make your trip better.
  
When adequate preparation is made in advance, camping can be a great experience. Preparing for a camping trip is not difficult, but its importance should not be underestimated. By taking the time to get organized, you can assure an enjoyable trip for everyone.
