I never leave security up to my neighborhood watch. I have always told my friends that neighborhood watch is only as good as your neighbors. At the risk of sounding pessimistic, what are neighbors really good for? I great my neighbors every now and then and I certainly would be glad to help them. I know the majority of my neighbors would return me the favor as well. I don&#8217;t however believe that they will sit at their window guarding my house.

Neighborhood watch is a great supplement to traditional security measure but not a replacement. I recently installed a Security Choice home alarm system. Some outdoor motion sensing flood lights also help make my home feel safer. Installing window locks is another measure that has made me feel a little safe, if I could only remember to fasten them after I close the window!

With a few good, traditional home security measure I feel a lot safer. If anything the additional security measure would be useful to alert my neighbors and neighborhood watch that something is going on at my house or on my property. From that point forward I am confident they would their part to make sure my home is secure. It seems rather unfair to expect your neighbors to be watchdogs for your home, however that doesn&#8217;t excuse neighbors from their human duties to help another in need.
