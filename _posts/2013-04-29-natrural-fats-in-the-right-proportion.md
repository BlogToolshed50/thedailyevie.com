Natural fats are a part of a healthy diet. They are amongst some of the healthiest foods you can eat, not health hazards.

The health benefits of natural fats comes from getting the correct balance of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat shown to have positive effects on many chronic health conditions including heart disease, obesity, brain function and immune system regulation. Omega-6 fatty acids are found in many processed foods and can interfere with the functioning of the Omega-3&#8242;s.

As often found in nature, balance is the key. We need both Omegas 3&#8242;s and Omega 6&#8242;s but in the correct ratio. Studies on diets over the course of time show humans have ingested about equal amounts of Omega 6&#8242;s and Omega 3&#8242;s. In the last 75 years Omega-6 consumption has soared and an approximate 20:1 ratio now exists. This is ten times the amount of Omega 6 fatty acid that is considered to be healthy.

Omega 6 fatty acids are primarily found in vegetable oils, processed foods and grain fed meat. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in cold water fish like salmon and organic meats. To tip the scales back towards a more health ratio try the following:

* Eat organic meats

* Avoid processed food

* Regularly eat cold water fish or take a daily supplement of fish oil

These simple steps will bring your own bodies store of natural healthy fats back to the right proportion.
