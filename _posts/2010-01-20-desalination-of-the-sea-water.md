Desalination of the sea water has come to the rescue of many Nations to tide over their water demand. In the countries where the rainfall is scanty and erratic adequate drinking water could not be made available. Hence, many companies in countries like Spain has come out with the technologies to purify sea water through desalination process to meet out the demand. Countries in the Middle east heavily depend on such desalination plants to feed their population.
