Thanks to my friend Alisha Evans for sharing this post.

My husband is a hospitality director who travels around the country to help open up nice restaurants. He is away for at least two weeks every month. We just had our second child and I needed some extra help so we bought a home in Houston, TX near my parentsâ€™ place. We are all set to leave New York next month.

My mom and dad are helping us secure the house. They have helped us scout locations and check out neighborhoods because travel is nearly impossible for me with a four year old and an infant. We have only seen our new house and neighborhood once. My husband actually had some time off so we flew down to seal the deal. The house is gorgeous. A six bedroom plantation style house with three gardens and a pool. The neighborhood is a charming, gated community and close to the major shopping districts!

Since Don will be away so much we had to make sure the house was safe. He replaced the old alarm system with an Adt Wireless Security System and had all the locks changed. I hate dogs but we have our security cat, Zoey. Actually, we are not too worried. The community has a great reputation for safety plus they have a security company that patrols 365 days a year. To be honest, I am more worried about being bored than being vulnerable. I am used to New York City. This place should fear me. But for sake of our children, I am very happy we moved to such a safe spot.
