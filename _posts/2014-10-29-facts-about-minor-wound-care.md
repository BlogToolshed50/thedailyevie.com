You probably think you know all the facts when it comes to the topic of minor wound care &#8211; if you cut your finger, just dab a tissue on it and you&#8217;re ready to go! Unfortunately it is not as simple as that. Minor wounds deserve special treatment in order to heal most efficiently and minimize the appearance of scars. So before you peel off that bandage make sure you know the difference between the facts and the misconceptions on minor wound care.

Misconception: It is best to let a minor wound heal over with a scab.

Fact: Scabs actually impede the healing process by creating a barrier between healthy skin cells. The cells have to work their way under the scab in order to form new tissue and heal. Scabs can also be easily torn or scratched, causing re-injury.

Misconception: It is best to let a wound &#8220;breathe&#8221; or air out.

Fact: The best way to protect a wound is to cover it with a bandage until fully healed. Bandages that absorb a wounds fluid and maintain a natural moisture balance are ideal for healing and enables skin cells to migrate together to form new tissue.

Misconception: It is best to leave a wound uncovered.

Fact: Covering a wound with bandages is essential to wound care: a bandage provides extra cushioning and protection from any re-injury that may occur, as well as preventing exposure to water, germs and dirt.
