If you suffer from IBS, you have probably heard about fiber and its effects on Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Eating a sufficient amount of fiber is one of the major ways to help prevent IBS. By being aware of both the health benefits of fiber and how it affects your symptoms, you can use fiber effectively to ease the discomforts of IBS. There are different types of fiber, each with their own characteristics to help with your symptoms.

Fiber is primarily found in whole grains. Bread, spaghetti and other whole-wheat products are high in fiber to help your digestive system. In addition, most fruits and vegetables will help to increase the fiber in your diet. High fiber foods are known have a direct impact on Irritable Bowel Syndrome and the digestive tract. Sometimes, IBS is an indicator that your diet is not high enough in fiber.

One type of fiber is soluble fiber. Soluble fiber soothes the digestive tract, and helps to prevent both diarrhea and constipation&#8211;the two faces of IBS. Soluble fiber is typically found in starchy foods such as: rice, pasta, oatmeal, potatoes, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, bananas, applesauce.

Soluble fiber is able to dissolve in liquid, including the water you drink with your meal. This water absorption allows the fiber to move easily and quickly through the digestive tract. Drinking plenty of water with your meals will help soluble fiber to be most effective.

The other type of fiber is insoluble fibers. Insoluble fiber is typically found in the cellulose of certain foods. Seeds, root vegetables, cabbage, wheat bran and corn bran also contain high amounts of insoluble fibers. While insoluble fiber is a key part of a healthy diet, those with IBS should be careful to avoid insoluble fiber on an empty stomach as this can exacerbate your symptoms.

During an IBS attack, you may find that consuming additional fiber will help to relax your digestive system, and return you to normal. You may want to consider a fiber supplement, such as Metamucil or Fibercon, to relieve your symptoms.

As you begin to increase your fiber intake, be aware that your body has its limitations. If you are not accustomed to a high-fiber diet, be sure to introduce fiber slowly. This will give your body a chance to get used to processing the fiber. Over time, your body will adjust, and you will be able to increase your daily fiber intake.

Fiber is part of a healthy, balanced diet, and it is even more important for those suffering from IBS. It can help to reduce the symptoms, and even prevent them. The recommended minimum fiber intake is 25-33 grams per dayâ€”more is certainly better.
