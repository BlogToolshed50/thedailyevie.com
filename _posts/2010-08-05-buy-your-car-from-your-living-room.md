I live deep in the country and I didn&#8217;t know what I was missing online, until I bought huges net satellite internet service a few months ago. I&#8217;ve spent an obscene amount of time online since then, and I swear things are cheaper on here. Plus, finding what you want is so much faster!

Case in point: I bought myself a car three years ago and I used books, newspapers, talked to people, spoke to my mechanic for his opinion and finally spent three days searching car lots. It took forever. Well, the big reason I upgraded my internet speed was so my wife and I could have more access to information since we both needed cars.

The process couldn&#8217;t have been better. I looked up the same magazines I used three years ago, but I was able to set parameters to avoid looking through a million options. Then I went to sights to rate the quality of these cars almost instantaneously. I narrowed down the list to three vehicles in about four hours. The next day I set up appointments to test drive them and I had my new car the next evening. I saved about five days all told. Also, since I did so much information gathering the day before I knew what I could get away with asking price-wise.

Definitely go online to find your new car. You won&#8217;t regret it.
