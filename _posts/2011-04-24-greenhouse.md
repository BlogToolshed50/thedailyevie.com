Certain crops need a favorable climatic condition with moderate temperature and controlled humidity to enable to yield better. In this context the green houses came in to being to provide such controlled atmosphere. Polythene roofing is given that is waterproof, but allows sun rays to seep in. In hilly areas also this technique is used to prevent the crops from frost attack.
