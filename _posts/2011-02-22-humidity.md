Humidity refers to the moisture content in the atmospheric air. During summer, the moisture content is bound to be on lower side in general. But in certain countries the relative humidity level touches around 55% like in the Middle East. When the humidity is more, it leads to dehydration and loss of water in the body. Most of the people find it difficult to breathe during the summer when the humidity is more. Many sports persons suffered heavily because of the high humidity.
