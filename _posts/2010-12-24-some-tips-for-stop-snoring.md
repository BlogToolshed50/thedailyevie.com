You have to stop believing that snoring is a sign of a good night sleep. It&#8217;s not! And it will never be. It may be cute in the first few minutes. After a while, it starts to sound as if woodworking is happening in your room in the middle of the night. And this is annoying. But if you have been snoring for days and your whole family cannot sleep, then you have to act now. Try these tips to put an end to their misery. 

Stop drinking and smoking – These two can cause you to snore and wake up the whole block. The reason? Alcohol causes a partial collapse on your airways which can immediate start snoring. Smoking on the other hand causes blockage on the small vessels of the lungs and swelling on the tissue in the throat and mucus membrane in the nose. Smoking can result to sleep apnea. Take note that if you stop drinking and smoking, you are stopping other health risks as well. 

Sleep regularly – Sleeping for few hours each night can cause snoring. Why? Unbalanced sleeping patterns develop into respiratory instability while asleep. And there is nothing good about respiratory instability because it can lead to unstable breathing. Hence, you need to regulate your sleeping patterns. Set a specific time of sleeping. Wake up in the morning on the same time, every day. Sometimes, 7 to 8 hours of sleep is all you need.

Use anti snoring devices – There are many of them in the market. You can get homeopathic throat sprays and tablets, throat sprays, sleeping pillows, or nasal strips and dilators. These devices help your air passage to relax and take in and out the right amount of air needed for a silent sleep. 

Cure nasal congestion and allergies – If there is an inflammation on your of adenoids and/or tonsils which are caused by nasal congestion (cold) or allergies, you have to take decongestant or antibiotics. It is simple: treat nasal congestion or allergies and you will stop snoring.

Find a better sleeping position – Some people find it relaxing to sleep on the back while others are comfortable sleeping at the side. However, if the position you are comfortable sleeping in causes you to snore, better find another one. Sometimes, all you need to do is to change your sleeping position to open your airways and stop snoring. 

Lose some weight – There is nothing good about being an obese. It causes several health risks and of course, it causes that load noise you create while asleep. Lose some weight by getting regular exercise and taking, eating the right diet, and living a healthy lifestyle. 

Steer away from snore-triggers – If you are taking sleeping pills and products that contain antihistamines, then you are most likely a snorer. These are sedating medicines that relax the muscles and nerves. As a result, the muscle tone in the tissues of the throat relaxes and collapses. This triggers snoring just like the effect of cigarette smoking. 

Consult a doctor – Mild snorers can easily be cured. But there are cases in which snoring is a sign of other serious medical condition such as hypothyroidism or diabetes that requires surgical procedures. If you are snoring for some time this is the right time to consult a doctor.
