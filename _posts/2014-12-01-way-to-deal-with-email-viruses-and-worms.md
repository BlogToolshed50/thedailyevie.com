If you feel intimidated when someone tries to teach you something new on the computer, this article is for you!

In the course of my career, I&#8217;ve worked with many people who I knew were smart but were convinced that they couldn&#8217;t learn how to do new things on a computer. At some point, they&#8217;d convinced themselves that they weren&#8217;t one of those &#8216;computer people&#8217;. I would try to teach them how to do something that would make their work a lot easier or faster, and I could see them shut down immediately. &#8216;I can&#8217;t do stuff like that. I&#8217;m just not good at it.&#8217;

In a few cases, my colleagues were simply amazed that I knew how to do things like upload photos to the Internet or how to start a new folder in Windows. Some would tell me that I must have some special gift for technology. I would just laugh and tell them that nothing could be further from the truth! I have a degree in psychology. I&#8217;m not a math and science type of person, and if it weren&#8217;t for the patience of my tech-minded husband and friends, I never would have learned how to do these things.

The fact is, computers are such a part of our lives, that you can&#8217;t afford to think of yourself as not a &#8216;computer person&#8217;. The reason I think that a lot of people are intimidated when learning about computers is that so much of the instructions and directions are full of jargon and assume that people have as much technological knowledge as people who work with computers for a living.

I&#8217;m convinced that if I can do it, anyone else can do it too. All it takes is an open mind, confidence, and someone to explain things to you step by step in plain English.
