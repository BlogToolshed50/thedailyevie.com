Here are 4 problems that you can cure with food (but, not by eating it).
  
1) Disinfect a Wound
  
Pour a dab of honey on a cut before covering it with a bandage. Honey has powerful anti-bacterial properties. One New Zealand study found that honey was capable of destroying almost all strains of the most common wound-infecting bacteria. Another equally good option, turmeric.

2) Repair Dry Skin
  
Try rubbing a small amount of sesame or corn oil over dry skin on your hands or feet, to add moisture and seal it into the area.

3) Treat Poison Ivy
  
Got itching? Get milk. Soaking a kerchief in cold milk and then holding it on your skin will dry out the rash of poison ivy and help ease the itch.

4) Soothe a Sunburn
  
To stop the itch and burn, mix together a bit of dry oatmeal and cool water. Make it slightly slushier than if you were going to eat it, and spread the mixture carefully on your sunburned skin. This will relieve the pain and help reduce swelling.
