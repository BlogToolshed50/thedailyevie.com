Right-Brain and Left-Brain Decisions:There is right-brain decision making which is intuitive. And, there is left-brain decision-making that is systematic. Above is an example of right-brain decision-making. Intuitive decision-making hides the steps. You make a &#8220;belief-in-your-own-knowing&#8221; leap of faith when you trust and act on this kind of decision.

Recently I made the left-brain, systematic decision when I decided after seeing my cheeks and nose turn bright red from eating too many refined carbohydrates, that I would eat only what I knew was right for my body.

For several days my mind went crazy trying to get me to eat the wrong stuff. Here&#8217;s what it did then and for the past 40+ years:

• I heard my mind use scientific information it had previously gathered to its own &#8220;advantage&#8221; to try to get me to eat refined carbohydrates.

• I heard my mind discount all scientific information as to how excess weight happens and how refined foods effect that &#8211; as hooey.

• I found my mind leaving me completely confused about what is the right thing to for me to eat. And confusion is a very rare state for me. I may not know something but I generally know that I don&#8217;t know.

• I found my mind telling me that all this food preparation was too much work and takes too much time.

• I heard my mind telling me that eating the same things over and over is boring.

• In the recent past I&#8217;ve found myself being evasive to people who I want to think I&#8217;m following a special program perfectly.

• I have also watched my mind give me permission to eat whatever I want as if I&#8217;m the parent and the child at the same time.

• Often at the beginning of a diet, an eating program or an exercise program I&#8217;ve had strong enthusiasm and watched my thoughts generate real excitement only to have that feeling of enthusiasm fade and so too my resolve. My mind was now generating &#8220;it&#8217;s not so great&#8221; thoughts and so my feelings followed suit.
