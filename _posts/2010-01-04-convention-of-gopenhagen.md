The recent convention at Copenhagen on climatic changes had only exposed the parochial nature of the attitude that is prevailing among the various nations. Though everyone recognized the importance that is to be given for this vital issue, an agreement binding on the nations could not be arrived. The rich nations do not like to reduce the growth at the cost of reduction in the carbon emission. Where as the developing nations too adhered to their stand that any legally binding agreement will come in the way of growth.

It is worth mentioning that at least they have recognized the need for an un-written agreement to limit the rise in the global temperature within two degree Celsious and contribute about $30 billion to help the developing nations to embark on the specific schemes to reduce the carbon emission that is the major source of global warming.

As a common man we expect the leaders of the leading nations like the USA, U.K, China, India, etc., to redesign their strategy to ensure the growth by going green to save the human kind and the future generation. The fund of $100 billion to be contributed by the rich nations towards the goal of limiting the temperature rise should be properly put in to use. Let us hopes for the best and wish that wisdom prevails upon the world leaders to save the universe.
