The motivation is just like happiness that something we choose. We may need to give ourselves a little push at the beginning, but once we get into the right mindset, it&#8217;s simple to stay there if we choose to.

Get Excited &#8211; Think about the things you have planned for the day, and rekindle the enthusiasm you once felt for them. When we first begin a new project, or start a new job, we are excited about the possibilities and eager to get moving! Over time, we can lose that enthusiasm for a variety of reasons. Travel back in time for a moment, and think about what got you so excited at the beginning. What made your heart beat a little faster? Recapture that feeling and hang onto it! Even if your tasks aren&#8217;t anything to be really excited about, at least think of some positive benefits to doing them. For example, list the ways they will benefit your children, your spouse, yourself, your job or your home. Identify the payoff, and focus on that. Even mundane tasks have some benefits. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a matter of switching our mindset to see the positive side.

Finally, remember to reward yourself from time to time, and be gentle with yourself! There will always be things that &#8220;need&#8221; to be done. But some of us take on way more than we can handle, and our lives turn into a pit of drudgery because of it. Try to eliminate the things that truly don&#8217;t bring you joy, or at least minimize the time you spend on them. Do what you can, and let the rest go. Or ask for help. Don&#8217;t feel you have to do everything yourself.
