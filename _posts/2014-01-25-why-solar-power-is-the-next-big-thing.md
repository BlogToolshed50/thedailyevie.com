There are several compelling reasons why solar power is going to be massive over the next few years. Enrolling on a solar training course and why getting into this industry could be the best thing you ever do.

11 Reasons Why You Should Do It

\# Solar power is better for the environment than fossil fuels and once it reaches cost parity it will explode.

\# Solar power is growing in popularity and can be used to heat swimming pools, power cars, mobile phones, ipods and other small appliances.

\# Solar power is a renewable resource that will never run out.

\# The earth receives more energy from the sun in just one hour than the whole world uses in an entire year.

\# Shell Oil predicts that by 2040, 50% of the world&#8217;s energy will come from renewable sources such as solar power. Many major companies like Shell run their own solar training courses.

\# Two billion people in the world don&#8217;t have access to electricity. Solar power can solve this.

\# If you produce even more energy than you use, your utility company will buy it back from you.

\# Solar power is not affected by the supply and demand of fuel and is therefore not subjected to the ever-increasing price hikes.

\# By not using any fuel, solar panels do not add to the cost and problems of storage of radioactive waste or pollute the environment with the transportation of fuel.

\# Once your solar panels are installed, there is no more outlay! Its just savings. They are immediate and will last a lifetime.
