One of my buddies at work was talking at lunch one day about a trip he had just gotten back from from Las Vegas. I listened to all of his stories and said that I want to go. He couldn&#8217;t believe that I had never been and here I was getting ready to retire. So he swore to me that he would take me to Vegas.

Well we&#8217;re getting ready to leave in a few weeks for it and I couldn&#8217;t be any more excited. I just retired so I think this will be a really good way to start off that period in my life. But before we go, I wanted to make sure that I would have as much fun as possible and get a few things in order so I stopped by to get a free hearing test, which I had been putting off. I was afraid that getting a hearing aid would make me feel older but once I got one I felt younger because I wasn&#8217;t worried that I was hearing everything people were telling me wrong.

Now I&#8217;m even more ready to go to Vegas and hoping that I&#8217;ll have such a good time that I won&#8217;t be able to wait to go back again.
