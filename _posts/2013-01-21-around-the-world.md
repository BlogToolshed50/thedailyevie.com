The greatest opportunity to see the world, one of the things always named when somebody is asked “what you your spend your million dollars on?”, the adventure, the dream &#8211; round-the-world voyage now has become a reality for many well-to-do people.
  
Round the world, of course, doesn’t mean that you see all the countries, but the most interesting of them. So, there still a choice of the voyages, which can be called round the world.
  
Those are some of the variants
  
At first, you have to choose your mean of transport – plane or cruise liner. Plane trip are shorter in time and you can miss something on the way, making stops only in the major cities of your trip. There are several variant of such trips
  
1) Amsterdam – Singapore – Sydney – Brisbane – Auckland – Tahiti – Santiago – Buenos-Aires – Iguazu – Amsterdam. It’s a good choice if you are interested in Latin America and Australia, but you totally miss Africa and see little in Europe and Asia.
  
2) London – Hong-Kong – Sydney – Brisbane – Auckland – Easter island – Iguazu – London. Again, lack of Africa.
  
The choice of sea cruises is wider, but be prepare to spend several months on the liner.
  
This list of opportunities usually covers all the continents, but the duration of stay may vary. So, let’s name some variants
  
1) Starting in New York, cruising the Atlantic Ocean, the Great Bahama Bank, Caribbean Sea, Panama Canal Transit, then cruising Pacific Ocean , Acapulco, Los Angeles, Honolulu, Kailua Kona, Papeete, Moorea, Cross International Dateline &#8211; Lost Day, Auckland, Lyttelton, cruising the Tasman Sea, Sydney, Phillip Island, Melbourne, Adelaide, cruising the Indian Ocean, Exmouth, Padang Bay, Cruising the Makassar Strait, Cruising the South China Sea, Subic Bay, Cruising the Luzon Strait, Nagasaki, Osaka, Cruising the East China Sea, Keelung (Taipei), Cruising the Taiwan Strait, Hong Kong.
  
This will take about 2 months.
  
2) If you want to receive the most complete cover of world attractions you may need about 3 or 4 months.
  
You&#8217;ll depart from Los Angeles and will see Oahu, Maui, Raiatea, Bora Bora, Tahiti, Auckland, Tasmania, Melbourne, Sydney, Coral Sea, Thursday Island, Cruising the Arafura Sea, Darwin, Bandar Seri Begawan, the South China Sea, Hong Kong, a Long Bay, Hanoi, the South China Sea, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok, Ko Samui, Singapore, Malacca Strait, Phuket, Indian Ocean, Male, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Luxor and Karnak, the Suez Canal, Cairo, the Mediterranean Sea , Santorini, Athens, Istanbul, Kusadasi, Venice, Split, Sicily, Naples, Sardinia, Porto Venere, Lisbon, Cruising the Atlantic Ocean, Bilbao, London.
  
The European part of cruise also often includes Spain with Barcelona.
  
As you can see all the routes have little of Africa, but except the above-mentioned Egypt they sometimes come along the South Africa.
  
These are the usual tours prepared by the travel agencies, but if you have different preferences, you may create your own trip plan. You can either organize it by yourself of order an individual tour in travel agency – anyway you are free to embody all your desires.
