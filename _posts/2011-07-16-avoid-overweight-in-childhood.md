The issue of overweight has assumed a significant place in the world and started affecting the population heavily. I was surprised to read a data where it is observed by the WHO that as much as 22mn children under five are overweighted in the world. If this trend is not reversed, it is certain to lead to a disastrous consequence in the future. In fact, the cause of this deadly plagues is not the rats, but the level of affluence we are witnessing due to the economic revolution around the globe.

Though the environment and the climate contribute for this menace to certain degree like in the middle east area, the inclination of the people towards fast foods and sugary drinks has made the problem the worst. Lack of physical exercise and sedentary life too contributed to the obesity that is affecting the people since they become vulnerable to various heart diseases due to excess weight. It is up to the parents to ensure that the children are given with the balanced natural diet to avoid the obesity in the initial age which will prevent the future weight related issues.
