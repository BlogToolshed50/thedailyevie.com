It is ever so easy to get into a rut. We humans are creatures of habit and we tend in the main to stick to patterns of behavior which have grown familiar to us. We tend to keep on repeating the same patterns even when we know that they are not working for us. In fact, it is often the case that the more we know we need to get out, the deeper the rut we inadvertently dig for ourselves.

This is especially true when we are experiencing stress. We just keep on doing the same things again and again in the vain hope that the results will somehow miraculously change. It is easy for an observer to question why you do not simply change what you are doing or the way in which you are doing it; but somehow you don&#8217;t quite think about this yourself.

There is actually a very good reason for this apparently rather &#8220;stupid&#8221; behavioral tendency. When under stress, the logical reasoning part of the brain which is found in the higher cortex can sometimes be bypassed; the result is an inability to think logically and clearly. Stress can in this way make us &#8220;stupid&#8221;. Stress is a threat and this is a trigger to the primitive brain to take action; the action sought will be the most familiar reaction to us, hence keeping doing what you have been doing.

I overheard someone saying that &#8220;the difference between a rut and a grave is just the dimensions&#8221; and this is indeed a very true statement. When one is feeling stressed, an awful lot of pressure is put upon one&#8217;s physiology. Everything speeds up and tightens up; your heart beats faster, your pulse begins to race, your blood pressure becomes higher and so on. If you do not learn to stop this cycle, the rut you are digging may indeed become your grave.

The way in which to get out of a stress induced rut is actually a lot simpler than one might think. Just by stopping doing what you were doing you relieve some of the pressure. You get away from the panic caused by knowing that whatever you are doing isn&#8217;t working. When you know something isn&#8217;t working you tend to try harder and harder to make it work, rapidly building the pressure you are feeling and becoming ever more stressed. If this has been happening to you, just stop; stop doing what you have been doing.

Now let&#8217;s think about climbing out of that rut. We need to make sure that your logical and reasoning mind is fully engaged and to do this you need to relax. Just by learning to use self hypnosis you can relax at will and ensure that all areas of your brain are working on full power instead of firing off a single cylinder, so to speak. Hypnosis is normal and natural and easy to learn with the help of a hypnosis mp3 download. As you practice hypnosis you get better and better at it.

The next step is to ask yourself what alternative ways there are of dealing with your circumstances. You already know that what you were doing before was as effective as banging your head against a brick wall. By learning to stop and relax you are on a far better pathway to finding a more appropriate solution to whatever was causing you stress.

Often the solution is not so much in acting differently; rather it is in learning to think differently. A problem is only a problem if you see it that way. Stress is only felt if you think of something as stressful. With hypnosis you can learn different mental strategies and find ways in which to relax and let go of things which previously caused you stress and tension.

If you feel that you are in a rut, don&#8217;t just keep on digging; that is a sure way to an early grave. It&#8217;s time to stop and relax and to learn to think differently.
