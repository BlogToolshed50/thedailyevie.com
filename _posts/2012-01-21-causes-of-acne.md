Acne can be found in many forms. Pa pules, which are usually characterized by small pink bumps, painful to the touch; Pustules or pimples, pus filled lesions that can be red, Nodules which are lesions lodged deep within the skin and finally Cysts, possibly the most painful form of the disorder, are usually responsible for scarring. Doesn’t sound fun, does it? Good thing there are ways to prevent the problem, but first you must understand what causes it to form.

Doctors are unsure of the exact cause of this disorder, but many believe it to be due to several different reasons. During puberty, in both males and females, an increase in hormones called androgen cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge, thereby producing more sebum. Additionally, hormonal changes due to pregnancy can also cause this skin disorder. Genetics also seem to play a role in the formation, meaning the tendency to develop it can stem from whether your parents had it or not. Pore-clogging cosmetics and certain drugs (Lithium, for example) have also been known to make the situation even worse.

What can make it worse? Well, for starters, friction. Rubbing, excessive scrubbing, or leaning on the skin, especially your face, can lead to an increase. However, chocolate and greasy foods do not cause this problem. Neither does stress nor dirty skin. It’s nice to know we can still enjoy a chocolate bar without worrying about a gigantic pimple cropping up!
