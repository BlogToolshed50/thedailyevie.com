Are you running into the same responses again and again? You say the right words you follow the script to the T and yet successful prospecting eludes you? I am here to tell you that it is not just the words, but the music behind the words.

Do you attract or repel people with your music?

Why is it that some people’s voices inspire? Some make us cry? Is it only the words that affect us, or is there truly something more to it? There is definitely something more intrinsic! It is one of the secrets to my success and a key that opened the lock of prospecting for me.

What is your song and the music behind your words? It is the energy and emotion that is felt when you speak. This is how people perceive you even if you are saying the words perfectly… If you are not in the conversation emotionally you are leaving your prospects cold!

When people learn to connect to their purpose and become emotionally grounded in it they begin to see the success in life that they are seeking.. This is a major key to authenticity and necessary for you to have energy and emotion behind your words. Who am I? What drives me? And Why am I on this path? These are all great questions that need to be answered but how?

I will assist you on your journey, a great and wonderful journey to realize your purpose. You can start this process right now, exactly where you are. Alright here is my secret….

Just stop? That is right… I said stop. If you are immersed in chaos and clutter your mind will not allow you to just stop and be quite. By getting in touch with the silence around us and comfortable with whom we are, we will exude that peace and acceptance to those who hear our words. Write down a list of things you are thankful for, things you have accomplished and your attributes. These will help you get started on your connection to purpose. Read over this list morning and night for at least 21 consecutive days. At the end sit down in quite place and put your name in the center of a paper, without looking at your list fill the rest of the paper with attributes and adjectives that describe you…. Now take out 3 things that stand out to have the most words that coincide, like helping people, inspirational, teacher…. So on. These words should give you a sense of peace and joy when you look at them…… Now form a purpose statement using these words and the products/service you are promoting….Repeat this statement often at least 3 times a day especially before you prospect for the next 21 consecutive days.

On your path to finding your song, remember we are all just souls having a human experience? So embrace your soul and sing your unique song? Just like in the great movie, Happy Feet. You don’t have to sing in tune, just be your own beautiful, wonderfully made self. When you live this your words will reflect who you really are and your prospects will naturally be drawn to you.
