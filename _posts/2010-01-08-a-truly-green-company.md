Every other day when I am back form work, I see a huge pile of mails on my mailbox. Most of those mail are junk and things that I never signed up for. The biggest problem of having such junk mails is losing to your important emails in the pile. Most than the frustration that it creates for me as a person, I assume it would be more detrimental for the planet. It is important to not waste so much paper on junk mails that most of us don&#8217;t even open. I always wondered if there was a &#8216;don&#8217;t mail me&#8217; list ever prepared similar to the &#8216;don&#8217;t-call-me&#8217; list to keep away from unwanted phone calls. It is important to minimize the amount of junk mails and to recycle the mails in the best manner.

I recently came across a wonderfully innovative company by name Greendimes. &nbsp;pankaj shah greendimes&nbsp; offers annual subscription to help you fight back at those junk mails. Once you are subscribed the company tries to contact the direct advertisers to keep your mail address of their vicious list. This is an innovative service that uses automatic and manual modes to pull your mail address out of the mailing lists of many direct marketing companies just $3 per month. I am sure this will bring in the revolution to reduce junk mails on our mailboxes.
