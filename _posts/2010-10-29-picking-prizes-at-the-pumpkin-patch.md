Every year, my family loves to head to the pumpkin patch to pick out the best and biggest bright orange pumpkins. We usually buy several, so that we have a few to decorate with, a couple to carve, and of course, an extra one or two to make pumpkin pie with.

This year, we decided to head out on a Saturday afternoon in early October. My husband and I got the kids together in jeans and hoodies, packed a couple of snacks and books for the car ride, and took everyone out the door. I pulled the car around from the garage while he set our ADT home security alarm, and then we started on our way to the pumpkin patch.

Once we arrived, the kids could hardly stand their excitement and ran straight through the gates and into the field. My youngest son found an especially large pumpkin right away that we knew we had to have &#8211; it was so big that he fell right over when he tried to lift it!

After about an hour of looking around, we had chosen what were clearly the seven best pumpkins in the entire patch. We paid for our treasures, loaded them into the trunk, and went back home. Once we got there, we started right away on decorating the front porch, and baking pumpkin seeds.
