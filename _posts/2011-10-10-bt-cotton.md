BT Cotton has become a controversial matter when introduced in many parts of the world. Though it is resistant against the boll worms which causes severe damage to cotton crop, there is an element of fear in growing the same. BT Cotton is believed that compels the farmers to go in for procuring the seeds at an exorbitant cost as the seeds cannot be recycled as in the case of conventional cotton seed. Many vouch that, it is not environmental friendly.
