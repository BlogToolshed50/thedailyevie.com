Like almost any little boy, my son is obsessed with superheroes. Every one of his Halloweens, he&#8217;s dressed up like a different superhero and he decided this year that he&#8217;s going to dress up like batman.

I don&#8217;t think that Batman is a costume that you can really make yourself like my wife has made for him for past Halloweens, so we&#8217;re just going to buy one for him online. When I was looking a costume for him the other day with our CLEAR wireleless internet I found a really great costume for a good deal that&#8217;s just his size.

While I was at it, I saw some really great Batman Tshirts that I knew he would really like. It&#8217;s so hard to convince him to wear even regular clothes that don&#8217;t have anything to do with super heroes. Plus, I saw some great things that heÕll love for Christmas presents.

There was a bat signal that I think IÕm going to buy and give to him for Christmas. It was a little expensive, but heÕs really going to love it so I think itÕs going to be worth it.
