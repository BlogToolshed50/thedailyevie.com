This guest post compliments of my friend Greyson Sterling.

It has been a long time since I have found a show that has grabbed my attention like the Office, which comes on weekly on direct tv packages. I have recently started recording all of the episodes that air in syndication so that I can catch up on all of the seasons that I regretfully missed. We can all relate to the work ethic and problems that arise from having an incompetent boss like Michael Scott. He is definitely the glue that holds the show in my opinion.

Steve Carrell fits the role to a tee. I recently was able to schedule the UK version to record on my DVR as well. I happen to really enjoy British humor like this, but cannot find the urge to break away from the US version. There is just something about Steve Carell&#8217;s face that really makes me and my family crack up constantly. I really like his one love interest, played by Melora Hardin. There is no way that a woman as hot as her would ever have anything to do with such a quirky character as Michael Scott, but that is part of the humor of it. He constantly destroys anything that he gets his hands on, and makes daily work life for all of his employees a total nightmare. I highly recommend this one!
