Guest post of the week by Roscoe Harris

After starting my new diet or &#8220;life change&#8221; as I now call it, it&#8217;s hard for me to find places to go out to eat with the family. A good friend of mine mentioned that Ruby Tuesday&#8217;s has a great Salad Bar and it very reasonably priced. So I packed up the family, set my security choice door alarm before we left, and headed out to dinner.

We were greeted at the door by our wonderful hostess and immediately seated in a booth nicely sized for our family. I started to look over the menu thinking to myself I might not have to eat from the salad bar; although on the way to our booth I glanced over at it and it looked amazing. The menu had everything from Avocado Shrimp Salad to Fork Tender Ribs and Louisiana Fried Shrimp. When our waitress came to the table I was impressed quickly. She wasted no time getting to the table and taking our drink orders; all the while having a huge smile on her face. Now days having a server greet you like they actually want to be there is so hard to find.

So I ended up nibbling off my husband&#8217;s plate and ordering the salad Bar. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone! The food is great and the atmosphere is just delightful! We&#8217;ll be making this a weekly visit from now on.
