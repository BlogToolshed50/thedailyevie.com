I love to hike no matter what time of year it is but fall is my favorite season. The kaleidoscope of colors, the crunching of leaves beneath my feet and even the smell of the crisp fall air make hiking this time of year a very sensual experience. Before leaving on my hiking expedition I always make sure to set my home security alarm system so I had to find ADT home security near brooklyn. That&#8217;s especially important to me since I live so far out in the country. My favorite place to hike is at a nearby state park where the kiwanis club has developed several miles of hiking trails. The views in the from the trails at the Paintsville Lake area are spectacular. The hills and lake provide a very scenic trek up and down and around the winding trail. From one side of the trail I can see Paintsville Lake with its boats and ski jets. Occasionally I will see a fisherman or be passed by a jogger along the way. As I walk I can study nature because someone has taken time to identify the trees and place an information marker about each type. On the other side of the trail I can see parts of the Mountain Home Place, an old time farm that has become a major tourist attraction for my area. No wonder I love hiking here!
