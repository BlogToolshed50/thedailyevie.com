One man is certain to become of the most compelling and significant figures of the 21st Century. Once destitute, he is now rapidly becoming a director and adviser in helping others to realize success and inspiring people to take control of the course of their life. Bruce is coaching people how to understand their hidden talents to do more, be more and have more in every area of life. One of Bruce goals is to help others, which means having abundance in all areas of their life with happiness and ease. Bruce intention is to help others release the road-blocks that stop them from manifesting their desires and teach them simple to follow principles that will help them realize their dreams. 

His life is an encouragement and the fact he has overcome adversity and has become a successful author is motivating others to go after their dreams. Taking the words to heart that if you can dream it and believe it, you can achieve it, Bruce is achieving things others only dream of. He is not just realizing his own dreams but he is sharing his story and the secrets to his achievement with others.

Taken on another challenge in order to prove that the philosophy that he shares with others works. He has begun â€˜The 100 Day Reality Challenge with the Intention of becoming a Best Selling Author within 100 days.

&#8220;It is not enough just to tell others about a principle or idea, ideas are best proven by having experienced them first hand. While sometimes principles can be shared that have been proven by someone else, once you have personally taken part in a principle and achieved it yourself, you can now pass it on as first hand knowledge. I am prepared to lead the way and hope that others will follow this example.
