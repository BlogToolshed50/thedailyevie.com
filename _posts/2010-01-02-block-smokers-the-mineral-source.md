Black Smokers, the mineral source recently found by the scientists are something astonishing. When I read the article I was wondering about the bounty that we are blessed by Mother Earth. When our greed towards various minerals for both industrial and personal uses increased, the new discovery of various additional sources has become a plus point in our exploitation.Scientists have proved that the &#8220;Black Smokers&#8221; are formed ONE Kilo meter below the sea level and they contain the precious metals like gold, Silver, Iron and the more. These are formed beneath the sea due to the geological activities that led to the formation of volcanoes.

The crust of the earth is divided in to six large plates and a number of smaller plate as well. When they collide at each other, enormous heat is developed up to 400 degree Celsious. The magama, which is emitted from the volcano in the sea bed area gets heated and the sulphur and gold present in them get dissolved in the hot water. When the minerals rich water flows down through the cracks it comes in to contact with the cold water. The minerals solidify in to tiny particles and the water becomes black. Ultimately these particles become chimney like tubes that are termed as the &#8220;Black Smokers&#8221;

The black smokers are said to contain gold at concentrations five to ten times more than the one found in the West Australian gold fields. Scientists are on the job to exploit this source to reap the fruit of this deposits. The wonderful part of this treasure is that it is renewable and it can re-form.

Human beings are know the means to use the nature to satisfy his needs through technology.
