Bright colors and creative displays can help to draw attention, especially for the younger crowd. Are you trying to sell iPods? Don&#8217;t just put an image up with an iPod all by itself, show a group of young people sharing an iPod with one ear piece. This is a form of “display window” that is online and can be quite persuasive. 

If you are doing videos, why not put up skins around the videos to set them apart from all the other sites out there? You can put up some colorful chrome video frames to help the images pop on the page. The same can be done for your copy by using colorful fonts and colors to emphasize particular words or features of your products.
