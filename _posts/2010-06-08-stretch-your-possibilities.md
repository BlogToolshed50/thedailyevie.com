Guest blog post from James Hetfield.

The greatest time of the year is summer when life moves from the indoors to the outdoors. Satellite TV takes a back seat to being outside in the fresh air enjoying all the activities nature and humankind have to offer, but I am able to find all the baseball games that I want to watch on Direct.TV. With longer daylight hours summer is the time to stretch your possibilities.

Some of the favorites include: hiking in the mountains (the pristine beauty of nature is never boring or stale), outdoor sports especially baseball (purely an American tradition), sailing on blue waters whether on the ocean or clear lakes and endless rivers, fishing in cold mountain streams, outdoor concerts and events, picnics in the park, the wonderful 4th of July celebrations and fireworks, and last but certainly not least the Barbeque. You can smell the burgers and hotdogs cooking as you read this.

Summer is also a time for vacations to places exotic or traditional depending on one&#8217;s taste and wallet The proverbial road trip is an American tradition going back to the end of the second world war when the interstate system was inaugurated. If you can remember, you cannot forget moving down the highway passing nameless towns and road stands not really knowing your final destination because only dad knew that.

The only real issue about summer is that is too short and before you get your second wind it is over but while it is here enjoy every moment and live it to the fullest.
