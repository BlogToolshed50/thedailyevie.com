Nuclear Energy has become the hot topic for discussion at the Copenhagen meets on climate change. It is reported to be a better alternative source to reduce the carbon emission. It is a matter of great concern to note that, the energy that can preserve the climate in the universe is exploited to put in to destructive use by certain vested interest. If the leaders of this world takes a positive opinion on the usage of this vital energy source for the up liftment of the human kind, it will go a long way to maintain the ecology.

Nuclear energy is carbon free and it is satisfying to note that this energy covers about 16% of world energy needs. It is devoid of carbon emission like hydro energy. Since power generation is accounted for a third of all Greenhouse Gas emission, it is pertinent that the meet at Copenhagen deeply discuss this issue of expanding nuclear energy to preserve the climate in a conducive manner. Usage of nuclear energy is sure to prevent the greenhouse gas level from crossing the thresh hold limit of 450 parts per million. The cost of the nuclear power is also lesser when compared to the conventional energy sources. It is found and estimated that nuclear power plants reduce the carbon emission by two trillion kilograms annually.

When that is the positive aspects of nuclear energy in the matter of climate preservation in the world, the scientists and the political leaders must apply their mind to use this source for positive purposes to maintain the ecological balances.
