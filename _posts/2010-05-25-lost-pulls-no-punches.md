I don&#8217;t know about you, but the latest Lost episode, &#8220;The Candidate,&#8221; left me agape. Although it started out slowly, this episode had me furiously fast-forwarding the commercials on my Directtv&#8217;s DVR by the end. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Lost, and at this point I&#8217;m locked in &#8212; I HAVE TO SEE HOW IT ENDS &#8212; but the show has an annoying tendency to spend the first two thirds of a season shuffling the chess pieces around; moving the characters back and forth while the plot progresses little. Finally, they spend the last few episodes in a flurry of action, revelations, and plot twists. Sometimes this tendency means that when a character arc reaches catharsis amidst the rushed last few episodes, it doesn&#8217;t hold the weight that it should.

Case in point: tonight&#8217;s episode, where [MAJOR SPOILER WARNING] not one but three major characters meet their end. Sayid has been limping along all season with little to do, and finally is killed off from left-field. He almost wasn&#8217;t even on-screen when it happened! And as for Jin and Sun, they&#8217;ve been apart for two seasons and three years, and they are finally reunited last episode only for them to meet their end in a submarine. It&#8217;s heart-wrenching, and not really in a good way. These developments seem more like when a story kills off a major character just to show how high the stakes are, these aren&#8217;t like when, for instance, Charlie was killed in Season 3. That death felt weighty, and we were satisfied by the time it happened. If nothing else, I suppose we know the stakes heading towards the season finale.
