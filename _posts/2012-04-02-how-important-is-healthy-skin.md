How important is healthy skin? Considering that the skin is your body&#8217;s largest organ, it&#8217;s very important! We take care of our skin so that it can look smooth and beautiful. However, our skin has a more important role than making us look good: it acts as a barrier between us and our environment.

It protects us from the harmful rays of the sun, keeps us hydrated by preventing fluid loss from our body, and produces vitamin D (with the help of the sun) to maintain strong bones. The skin also plays an important role in maintaining our body temperature. Healthy skin goes hand in hand with a healthy lifestyle.

The general rule is that everybody needs to use some form of sun protection! People with sensitive skin should always use beauty aids that are mild. Always test the product on a small area on your arm to see how your skin reacts before using it on your face. Don&#8217;t assume that a &#8220;natural source&#8221; product doesn&#8217;t contain ingredients that can irritate your skin.

Try cleansing with gentle, milky, water-soluble lotions and tepid water. Avoid face-cleansing gels or soaps that contain drying alcohol, preservatives, or strong-acting acid, since these ingredients can irritate the skin. Do not use exfoliating scrubs or astringents on sensitive skin, because they can cause inflammation.
