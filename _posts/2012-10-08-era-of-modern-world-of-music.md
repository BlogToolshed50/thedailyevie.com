In Era of Modern world of Music.Eminem (actual name Marshall Mathers born in St. Joseph, MO &#8211; near Kansas City ) emerged in 1999 the first Caucasian rapper to make a significant impact in years with his rap music. He is known as protege of Dr. Dre. He was also knows as one of the most controversial rappers to ever grace the genre. Even with an unhappy childhood Eminem emerged successfully with his incredible skills in music and his success became the biggest crossover success the genre had seen since Dre&#8217;s solo debut seven years earlier.

The best popularity and publicity Eminem Music got from the controversy over his lyrics. His success over the years has given him a platform not afforded to equally talented African-American rappers. With him excellent (gifted) producer skills he overshadowed the media with his presence. He is known as combination of misogynistic and misunderstood genius.

As a teen he was attracted to rap music, at age of 14 he began to perform raps in the basement of his friend’s home. They went under the names Manix (soon changed to Eminem). He found the easiest way to win over underground hip-hop audiences was to become a battle rapper and improve against other MCs in clubs, due to the unavoidable racial boundaries that came with being a white rapper. In spite of initial rejections he became popular with his music. 

After his disappearance from world of rap due to his uncle’s suicide he returned to world of rap. New Jacks was the first group he joined. His first recorded single was released in 1995 after he moved to Soul Intent, Proof (performed the B-side) who worked with Eminem, asked him to form a new music group which gave birth to a new group named as D-12 with six-member crew. D-12 crew none other than Eminem own friends who supported each other as solo artist.

As a new father he took a break from world of rap after birth of his first child as he started working in order to care for his family. The bitterness in his life started to became part of Eminem lyrics and he started to make his personal experiences as topic of his rap music.

After a few good reviews he received for Infinite (debut record released in 1996) he broke his artistic rut. He created Slim Shady (released in 1997) fearlessly in his rap he downplayed many of the positive messages. He never feared anyone when it came to convey his own messages in his rap. In 1997 his mother was accused of mentally and physically abusing his younger brother which effected his innermost feelings, which provide him with a new gift of material to work on.

In 1998, his girlfriend left him and separated him from his child. He was barred from visiting his own child. He moved back with his mother, this bitter episode gave rise to hatred in his life and increased his sympathy for his brother, which in turn effected him whole life and became a drug addict and alcoholic and started writing an uncharacteristically dark material. This sad and bad epics in his life and unable to bare his unhappy life and depression led him to attempt suicide which are unsuccessful. He released the brutal Slim Shady EP (in 1997), a mean-spirited, funny, and thought-provoking record that was light years ahead of the material he had been writing beforehand. Making quite the impression in the underground not only for his exaggerated, nasal-voiced rapping style but also for his skin color, many quarters dubbed him the music&#8217;s next &#8220;great white hope.&#8221;
