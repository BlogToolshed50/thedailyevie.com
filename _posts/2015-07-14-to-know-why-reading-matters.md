We&#8217;re always telling children that books and reading are good for them, but have we ever really thought about why that&#8217;s true ? Exactly what do older children get out of reading novels ? What do younger kids get from being read to ? Does reading matter ? 

The purpose of this article is to say that, yes, it&#8217;s true, reading really is important, and that there are some solid reasons why that is so. Let&#8217;s begin with the practical benefits and then move on to the less tangible rewards of a life filled with reading. 

BOOKS HELP CHILDREN DEVELOP VITAL LANGUAGE SKILLS. 

Reading is an important skill that needs to be developed in children. Not only is it necessary for survival in the world of schools and (later on) universities, but in adult life as well. The ability to learn about new subjects and find helpful information on anything from health problems and consumer protection to more academic research into science or the arts depends on the ability to read. 

Futurologists used to predict the death of the printed word but, ironically, Internet has made reading more and more a part of people&#8217;s daily lives. The paperless society is a myth. The computer&#8217;s ability to process and analyze data means that endless variations on reports and other types of documents can be and are generated. Internet, itself an enormous new source of information and recreation, is based on the humble written word. To effectively utilize the web and judge the authenticity and value of what is found there, both reading and critical thinking skills are of prime importance. 

The more children read, the better they become at reading. It&#8217;s as simple as that. The more enjoyable the things they read are, the more they&#8217;ll stick with them and develop the reading skills that they&#8217;ll need for full access to information in their adult lives. Reading should be viewed as a pleasurable activity &#8211; as a source of entertaining tales and useful and interesting factual information. 

The more young children are read to, the greater their interest in mastering reading. Reading out loud exposes children to proper grammar and phrasing. It enhances the development of their spoken language skills, their ability to express themselves verbally. 

Reading, by way of books, magazines or websites, exposes kids to new vocabulary. Even when they don&#8217;t understand every new word, they absorb something from the context that may deepen their understanding of it the next time the word is encountered. When parents read aloud to children, the children also hear correct pronunciation as they see the words on the page, even if they can&#8217;t yet read the words on their own. 

READING CAN OPEN UP NEW WORLDS AND ENRICH CHILDREN&#8217;S LIVES. 

As mentioned above, reading opens doors &#8211; doors to factual information about any subject on earth, practical or theoretical. Given the wealth of available resources such as Internet, libraries, schools and bookstores, if children can read well and if they see reading as a source of information, then for the rest of their lives they will have access to all of the accumulated knowledge of mankind, access to all of the great minds and ideas of the past and present. It truly is magic !
