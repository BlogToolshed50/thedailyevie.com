Dry farming is practiced in tropical region where the rainfall is scanty. Mainly the dry crops like cereals are grown apart from the drought resistant cotton varieties. Such area is normally provided with periodical spray containing the needed nutrients to take care of the crop requirement. During monsoon rain the land is ploughed to enable the water to percolate and being stored to keep the soil wet. Application of chemical fertilizer is kept to the minimum in the case of dry farming.
