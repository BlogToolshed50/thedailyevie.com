Thanks for the guest post by Emmett Coffey

Summer brings a lot of opportunities for outdoor activities for children out of school. There are also many instances where children will be staying home alone. Here are some tips for both outdoor safety as well as for kids that have to stay at home alone.

The summer months bring with them plenty of heat and sunshine. Kids will often spend a lot of time outside without realizing the risks involved. Parents should be aware and monitor their children in the heat and take measures to ensure their safety.

Children playing outside should take frequent breaks so that they don&#8217;t become overheated. They can also become easily dehydrated, so fluid intake is important. Keep water and low calorie sports drinks readily available. Sweat-proof sunscreen &#8211; at least SPF 30 &#8211; should be worn at all times and reapplied as needed.

Kids staying at home alone should be aware of possible dangers and how to respond to them. Some good ideas include having a neighbor&#8217;s phone number posted in a prominent place near the phone, as well as a list of other emergency contacts. Children should be taught what to do in case of fire, burglary and power outages as well. A Home security alarm can be a useful tool to alert authorities in case of an emergency. Children should be taught how to arm and disarm the system if needed.
