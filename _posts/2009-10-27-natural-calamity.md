Of late the nature is creating lots of havoc in various countries. The recent happening in China and Myanmar vouch for this. It is due to the imbalance in the ecology. Over exploitation of the nature by the human being too added to the ill effects of the nature.

Increased de-forestation coupled with the emission of the carbon from the usage of automobiles too aggravated the situation. Recent earth quake created due to the geo-ecological imbalance had resulted in loss of lives in various places.

It is high time that human being should realize the need to save the nature and live along with the same without too much exploitation of the same Though many organizations are in the field it is up to the individuals to nurture the nature which will take care of the future generation as well.
