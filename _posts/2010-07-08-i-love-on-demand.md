The love of film is like a fine wine that grows sweeter with age. Many wonderful movies with the ability to restore damaged prints are clearer and sharper now than when they were originally released. A new generation can now enjoy the classic films of old and be introduced to the wonderful actors in those films. Watching movies on demand on my satellite tv internet package in Detroit is a great way to see a variety of films from the golden age of movies.

One of the recent old movies I saw as a boy and still love was, On the Waterfrontwith Marlon Brando, Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden, Eva Marie Saint, and Rod Steiger. I have probably seen this movie at least a hundred times but I never get tired of the rich characterizations, dialogue, romance, and story. What draws me to this type of film is the little guy and the struggles of the working class and the corrupt union bosses.

Brando plays a down on his luck former boxer working on the docks in New York. Lee J. Cobb is the corrupt union boss and criminal fleecing the workers. Karl Malden is the priest who acts as advocate for the workers. Eva Marie Saint in her movie debut plays Brando&#8217;s love interest and Rod Steiger plays Brando&#8217;s brother and strong arm for Lee J. Cobb.

What makes this movie timely and a classic is the strong performances of all the characters. There is not a weak performance in the film. The story line is excellent and Brando gives one of his most compassioned performances. You really feel for him especially in the last scene of the movie.
