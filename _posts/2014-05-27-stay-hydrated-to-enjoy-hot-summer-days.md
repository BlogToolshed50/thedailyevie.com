After a long, cold winter, Canadians can&#8217;t wait for summer! But often, summertime, welcome as it is, can bring sweltering heat and unbearable humidity, which can lead to dehydration.

Canadians need to be prepared for hot summer days. The most important thing to remember is to drink plenty of fluids to keep the body hydrated.

&#8220;For some people, drinking eight or ten glasses of water a day is hard to do. I encourage people who have difficulty drinking so much water to supplement their water intake with other fluids they enjoy drinking, like juices and lemonade &#8211; focusing on beverages without caffeine or alcohol,&#8221; says Sandra Edwards, Registered Dietitian and Sports Nutritionist.

Canadians, it seems, understand the importance of hydration because beverage sales peak during the dog days of summer.
  
When it gets really hot out, there&#8217;s nothing quite like a tall, cool glass of Brisk Lemonade to quench your thirst.&#8221;

When the body sweats, it not only loses vital moisture but essential minerals too, including potassium, a mineral found in abundance in fruits and vegetables. Eating healthy snacks replenishes minerals and helps absorb and retain fluids. So, remember to stock up on fresh summer fruits and veggies to stay hydrated and refreshed.

Even at work, you can dry out in the summertime. Just because air-conditioned environments keep you cool, doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re safe from dehydration. Climate-controlled buildings can zap body&#8217;s vital moisture. So sip on refreshing drinks, like water, iced-teas or lemonade all work-day long.
