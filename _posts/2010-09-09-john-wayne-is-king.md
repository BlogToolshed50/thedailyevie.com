Thanks to Roman May

Every so often a theater not far away has a John Wayne festival. It is an entire weekend of John Wayne films. He is the actor who has bridged the films of the past and has connected them to the present. One of the lesser rated movies called The Green Berets is a great flick. Lesser rated because it was pushing a political position.

I haven&#8217;t seen it for some time and it was on the schedule. I set my alarm system, giving me peace of mind, and headed off to the theater. It was how I expected it to be, great. No matter how many times you see this film, it is like seeing it for the first time. It is a dated film and a propaganda tool for the Vietnam War, but this does not take away from the artistic merit of the film.

It is good for the mind to go back in time through film every once in a while. Modern films with their technology are not necessarily better. It is more difficult to portray a film&#8217;s mood through black and white than through color, although The Green Berets was a color film from its inception.
