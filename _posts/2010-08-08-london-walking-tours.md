We love to visit Paris which has lots of places of historic importance. When you plan to undertake the Paris private tour with family and friends, then you can use the services of Context to enjoy the tour. The scholars and specialists at Context can help you to know better about Paris as they explain the importance of each place to make your tour memorable.

Context is having the well experienced people in the field of archaeology, cuisine, history and much more to explain you about the places you visit. During London walking tours, they join with you and explain the matter clearly to every one of you with personal care. They can design the walking seminars for smaller group of travelers to help them to know about the places in-depth.

One can get the participatory experience as the walks are narrative. Context is charging very reasonable fee for the London private tour and one can get the complete satisfaction of visiting various places in London and knowing the background of those places. You can visit the website of Context and know the details of their services and avail the same to make the London and Paris tour a memorable one.
