I have always wanted a show that personified what it was like for me to live my life, and that is why Hung identifies with me so much. Although he is a male prostitute and I am not, we still have a lot in common. Ray, who is the main character, often finds that women are trying to use him for his special &#8220;gift.&#8221; I can relate to that, and that is why the show is so enjoyable to me. I like the fact that I can set my New Jersey directv to record the show for me while I am out with my female companions, only to watch the next day afterward. Ray finds that he has to make a living as a male prostitute in order to support his family, and gets himself a pimp. The little lady that is his pimp is a trip. You would never expect her to be doing what she is doing for a living, pimping out a middle aged man. I&#8217;d say that if you have kids or even a girlfriend, I&#8217;d just record it for later. It is one of the most watched shows at my house though, because it just cracks me up. I can really relate to what ray, the main character, is going through on a day to day basis. Let&#8217;s just hope the show stays this good!
