For whitewater rafting in the Pacific Northwest, Oregon is an enthusiasts dream! The rivers available only short drives from the major cities provide beginners and experts, alike, with an exciting and fun challenge for half, one, and two day trips. For those who want a longer, more impressive experience, Oregon also offers some of the best four and five day river trips anywhere!

The Umpqua River is, simply put, a dream! Flowing North of Crate Lake, the Umpqua River has Class III and IV rapids and flows through some of the most beautiful surroundings in the Pacific Northwest. The Umpqua has exceptional pool-and-drop rapids and has more rapids per mile than any other Oregon river.

The Mackenzie River, specifically the Lower Mackenzie, is perfect for beginners and families. Usually run as a full day, the river alternates long, tranquil and relaxing stretches through beautiful country with spicy, exciting Class II (easiest) and Class III
  
(moderately challenging) rapids.

The John Day River is perfect for a multi-day trip, providing an excellent vacation for the family or group of friends that loves the outdoors and the river life. The river provides the opportunity for many different activities, such as camping and fishing, but also
  
provides an excellent long stretch of Class II (easiest) and Class III (moderately challenging) rapids.

The Rogue River is one of the most popular destinations in Oregon for multi-day raft trips. Located in southwestern Oregon, the Rogue River cuts through the beautiful terrain of the Siskyou Mountains. The river has over 80 rapids, with many Class III and a few Class IV surprises to spice up the trip.

The Deschutes River is one of the best-known rivers in Oregon. The river flows through spectacular desert canyons and rocky mountain vistas, for sightseeing, but also has great Class III and Class IV rapids for those more interested in trying their skill against the
  
river. The Deschutes River is very popular and, during the height of the season, youâ€™ll never lack for company along the river.
