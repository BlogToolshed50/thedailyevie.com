I do a lot of knitting, most of which is donated to various causes. I love to knit but I don&#8217;t know of many people that need more hats, scarves and blankets so I donate them to the homeless shelters and the hospital for babies as well as chemo patients. When it comes time for me to find new patterns or information, I jump on to my satellite internet CLICK HERE to search for the latest patterns and products that I can find. I have found many people giving away supplies for knitting as long as the person was donating finished items. Coupons for new knitting items are easy to find and I can save on some of the many items that I use regularly. It has helped me greatly since I live on a budget. I do get a large tax deduction at the end of each year for the work that I donate. It has been nice to have that extra bit of income at the beginning of each year. Without my knitting, I don&#8217;t know where I would be.
