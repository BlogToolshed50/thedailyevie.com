Blog post by my friend Robin Collins

DVR’s are the greatest invention ever for watching television. I’ve had a DVR ever since I switched from cablevision to satellite TV several years ago, and I don’t think I could ever live without it. Not only able can I record with my DVR, but my mlb extra innings costs less than I could have dreames. The acronym “DVR” stands for “digital video recorder” and it’s much like the telephone answering machines of today, recording data on digital media rather than the traditional tape of DVD.

DVR’s are easy to use and have so many handy applications. If I’m watching a game or a movie and I need to get up for a minute to grab a drink, my DVR gives me the ability to pause live television and come back to it when I’m ready. That is, when I watch live television!

Ever since I’ve had a DVR, I no longer say I that watch television, but that I watch “DVR.” I simply record the shows that I want to see and watch them when I want to watch them. This allows me to skip commercials, which is a great time saver. An average one hour program only takes about forty minutes to watch on a DVR.

Another great thing about DVR’s is that you never have to miss your favorite programs. They can be set to watch the listings for you, recording your favorite shows for you when they come on. When you’re ready to settle into some television, all you have to do is go to your programs list on the DVR and watch!
