The article written by Geraldo Russo

Although I never enjoyed back to school shopping as a child, I have grown fond of it in my college years. Gone are the days of wandering through stores trying to find new clothes and shoes with my mother. I have finally stopped growing, and as a result I no longer spend as much time looking for a shirt to match my new pants. Now when I go shopping, I get to look for things that interest me, rather than being forced to buy specific clothes, and follow a list of supplies to bring.

Typically shopping is spread out over the month before school starts. This allows me plenty of time to find what I have, but more importantly find out what I am missing. Clothes are generally low on the shopping list, right next to shoe and sock shopping. A shopping day generally consists of waking up at noon, setting the home security alarm before I leave, and browsing a few shops in the area.

After moving out of the dorms and into an apartment, I had the freedom to buy the things that I wanted to put around our home. My two roommates and I make a list of all the potential things that we want to buy. This ranges from a lamp for the living room, all the way to a pool table for the basement. Typically we write every idea down, no matter how expensive they may be. We have become quite good at finding good deals on used items.
