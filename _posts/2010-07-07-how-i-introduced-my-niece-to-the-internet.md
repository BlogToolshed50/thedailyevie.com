I kept trying to tell my niece about stuff that she should know about. I have a big interest in science and math and wanted her to share in that same interest. She&#8217;s nine so I have found that it easier to show her how something works than trying to explain it.

The problem was that I kept running into a barrier. I have been paranoid about showing her anything on the internet satellite because of fear of her seeing some kind of terrible add. So I had an idea to just always monitor the content first then show her.

I took my laptop over to my sister&#8217;s house and got permission to show my niece how a car works. They use one of the best satellite internet providers at their house so that was pretty cool. I was able to show my niece a few different diagrams of engines and how they work. Then I wanted to teach her how to change a tire.

First I showed her some photos of what can happen if you get a flat tire. I didn&#8217;t want to scare her, I just wanted to let her know that it happens and when it does that she should know how to fix it.

Of course, she won&#8217;t be driving for another six or seven years. I think that if she learns now though that it will help her in the long run.
