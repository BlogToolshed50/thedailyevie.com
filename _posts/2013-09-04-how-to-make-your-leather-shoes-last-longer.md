Good leather shoes are not cheap, so you should find a good way to make your shoes last longer. To protect your shoes well will help you enjoy more about your purchase. You may love to buy quality leather shoes but make sure you&#8217;ve found the right size for your feet. Good leather can make your feet breath very well and has some stretch for comfort. With the incorrect size, you will wear the shoes roughly. After new purchase and before wearing them, find a shoe repair store and put heel and toe plates on soles to protect the most exposed spots on your shoes.

You also can use thin rubber soles to prolong wear and stop slipping. Get polish with a suede cleaner if possible and clean your new leather shoes by using the right brushes. After wearing them, regular cleaning and polishing is very helpful for keeping their original looking. Have a brush to wash off the dust and clean up with saddle soap. Laces on the shoes should be removed before polishing the tongue. Make sure to use different brushes for the different colors of the shoes. Put laces back on after these things. You need a suede brush for suede leather shoes.

Remove the spots with a skill gum eraser. Spray-on suede cleaner is also useful. If suede boots get wet, put some paper into them, changing the paper a couple of times before the shoes get dry. Leather boots must be stored with shoe trees inside for keeping the shape, or use crumpled tissue paper to stuff in toes if you do not have shoes trees. When traveling, use a bag made of flannel to guard your shoes. You can never dry them with a direct source of heat.
