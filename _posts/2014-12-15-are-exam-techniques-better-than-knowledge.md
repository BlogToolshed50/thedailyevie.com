Half a century ago I learned about exam techniques. At that time I was snowed under with study, and my headmaster said that I had as much chance as the Man in the Moon of passing three Ordinary level GCE subjects.

He was right at that time! It didn&#8217;t matter how much study I did, term exam questions were always about stuff I hadn&#8217;t studied.

Then I learned that you perform best in an exam if you know more about exams rather than about the subject of the exam.

I liked that.

Using Exam Techniques

So I studied exam techniques. What were the results? I passed eleven GCE ordinary level subjects.

When artistic talent was handed out, my brother got it all, and there was none left for me. I panic every time I am asked to do a stick-drawing.

However in the GCE exam, my brother set out to do good art, and I used exam techniques to get good marks. To my great glee I got a better pass mark than my brother did. I was sure that proved that exams are unfair, but remained very smug.

Multiple Choice

My wife had a multiple-choice paper on a subject about which I knew nothing. I tried the exam techniques in my book. My wife assured me that I would have passed &#8211; without knowing anything about it.

Then came a time that I studied maths again, and I was hopelessly at sea. I learned maths where the best methods were those that worked &#8211; fast. New maths had been introduced since I was at college. Now the explanations were just nonsense to me. However when the exam came around, it was another multiple choice test, and I passed!

We&#8217;ve learned nothing

My daughter&#8217;s final exams were coming. I searched libraries for the most modern examination techniques, and received a great shock. All the books still advised lots of hard work. There was no mention of exam techniques at all.

They mentioned mnemonic techniques to help me remember, but I&#8217;d been using them since the middle of last century and knew how they could let me down.

The day before a university exam I decided that I would probably get a question about the life cycle of Fasciola hepatica. So I used a mnemonic technique to memorize every number in the complicated life cycle.

Next day the expected question appeared, and I remembered every number &#8211; BUT &#8211; I had forgotten the units. It was no use remembering the number 3 if I didn&#8217;t know if it was three hours, or three days, or three weeks, or three months, or three years. So I couldn&#8217;t answer the question. Fortunately examination techniques got me through the exam.
