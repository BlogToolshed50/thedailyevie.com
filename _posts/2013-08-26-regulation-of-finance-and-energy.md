Financial interests of the individual must be balanced with the financial interests of the nation and even the entire financial system. These interests are in turn conflicted by the interests of “shareholder values”, those of shareholders voting to determine “corporate governance” and corporate policies. Since we live in a nation state, with different conflicting goals, financial regulations are necessary.

There are people and institutions buying stocks and bonds who want a fair deal. They don’t want to lose their money because of their lack of knowledge of the stock market, or to be otherwise cheated. The need for regulations is to disclose information to investors, and deal with taxes, institutional questions and other problems of how the parts of the system affect the whole.

A system of overall regulation of utilities has been in place since the Pres. Franklin Roosevelt administration in the 1930s. Now this is in the process of being deregulated, with a lot of kicking and screaming and resistance.
  
This process sounds good in theory, but created billions of dollars of extra fees for the residents of California in the energy price crisis of 2001. Also, due to deregulation, one of the largest bankruptcy liquidation ever, that of Enron Corp. occurred. Despite collecting huge fees from deregulated electricity, Enron could not pay its debt from rapid expansion. Its accounting firm was also liquidated for creating a web of false profits and shell corporations reaching to offshore financial havens around the world. Without excess production of electricity, the “gaming” of electrical prices just was use to drive them to as high as ten times that of normal levels. The excuse for this was high electricity demand days in the hottest part of the summer.

By regulating electricity prices, you are creating reliable power supplies at a predictable price, which cannot be guaranteed if the price is raised suddenly in an arbitrary fashion. You are limiting the rights of shareholders of these utility companies to maximum profits. The problem is that even with physical commodities, there is no “natural price”, and many things are subject to political conditions and reasons, such as what you want to achieve
  
Government regulations can have unintended consequences in that they may shift money flows to other places. For example since mutual fund dealers are more heavily regulated then hedge fund operations, which go all over the world to make money, this could lead to more funds being shifted to hedge funds, or so goes the theory anyway. Sudden crises of hedge funds related to far-away financial and political events can create dangerous financial collapses, like that of the Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) hedge fund in 1998. This was related to the then collapse of the Russian bond market, a faraway even that usually would have little effect on the U.S. financial markets. Yet this collapse caused an urgent meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the organization of a $4 billion bailout of the collapsed hedge fund. In a crisis, theories of the “free market” are put aside to manage what is the greater good for society.
