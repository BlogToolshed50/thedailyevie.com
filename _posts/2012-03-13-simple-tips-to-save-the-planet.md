It does not matter what side of the global warming debate you are on, this article will help anyone who wants to save money. By making simple changes in our lives and thinking about particular habits and routines that we have, all of us can take simple actions to improve the quality of our lives, live a more eco friendly life, and save money by going green. 

1. Replace regular light bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs. If every household in the United States changed only 1 frequently used light bulb to a fluorescent light, we would save enough energy to light more than 3 million homes for one year. This is one of the easiest changes to make in order to save money and help save the earth.

2. Expand your batteries life span. It is best to buy rechargeable batteries but if that is not an option here are some tricks to increase the life of a battery.
  
• Do not replace all 4 batteries. When your device stops working, it may be because only one battery is dead. Try buying the self-testing batteries and check each one, only replace the dead batteries.
  
• Keep your batteries in the refrigerator to make them last longer.
  
• Believe it or not, your laptop computer does not belong on your lap. Laying a notebook on a soft surface restricts air flow and heats up the battery. To prolong the life of the battery, invest $5 to $20 in a &#8220;cooling pad.&#8221;

3. Get a home energy audit: Check to see if your utility company offers a free home utility audit to help you find air leaks, poor insulation and determine your homes energy efficiency.

4. From the home energy audit, you will likely be told to seal and insulate your home. You can hire a contractor or for the more adventurous try a &#8220;Do-It-Yourself-Guide.&#8221; This may cost some money up front but will definitely save money in the long run.

5. Keep your water heater warm by wrapping it in an insulation blanket. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, adding insulation to your water heater can reduce heat loss by 25-45%, thereby saving you 4% to 9% in water heating costs. You can buy these at any home improvement store for about $20.

6. Insulate your car&#8217;s battery. Check to see if your car&#8217;s battery is insulated properly, if not buy a plastic insulated battery blanket for $10 to $30.

7. Charge your batteries with solar power. Pay a onetime fee of $80 to $200 and then charge your batteries for free for years and save money.

8. Unplug unused electrical devices and save money on your electricity bill. This is easier said then done. Start by unplugging your cell phone and i Pod chargers. In addition buy a power strip that allows you to turn it on and off easily.

9. Turn off the lights and go green! This may seem like a no-brainier but it is amazing how many people keep their lights on, television running, and computers going. Turning these off will not only save money on your electricity bill but will add in our efforts to save the earth.

10. Keep your thermostat between 68 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit. Use blankets, open windows and take off layers of clothes. For most of us, this is easier said than done. Remember to turn off your thermostat when you go to work and when you go to bed. If you forget, get a programmable thermostat. This can save a considerable amount of money on your heating bill.

Important facts to keep in mind: First it does not require more energy to reheat your home than it does to keep it at the same temperature. Second, turning the temperature up higher does not make the house warm up faster, it only makes the heater stay on longer after turning it off.

11. Stop using store catalogs and shop online. Most of the time you save money online anyway.

12. Stop receiving junk mail. Millions of trees are lost each year on junk mail alone. You can try to get your name deleted from the junk mail sources or spend a little time and write on each junk mail received, &#8220;Return to Sender.&#8221; You do not have to pay for the postage and eventually you will stop receiving mail from them.

13. Print less often. Write down directions on small note pads, do not print emails. If you need to print there are free software programs out there that allow you to edit web pages to only print the content that you need.
