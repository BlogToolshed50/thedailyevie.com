This guest post from Lewis Beck

Last month I decided that I wanted to change all of the artwork that I had displayed throughout my home. I also realized that I had very little money to do this with. But, since I had already made up my mind to change everything, I was going to change it all. I decided that I would have to be very crafty when it came to making changes. I have always been pretty talented artistically, so I decided that I would just try and make a few of the pieces that I wanted to hang around my home. I also decided that the internet would probably have a few great ideas for me to check out.

I started off by checking out a few different decorating blogs using the Clear 4g deal I got last year. I found so many great ideas about fixing up pieces of art from thrift stores and redoing lamps and accessories that I immediately started shopping around second hand stores. I had a couple of projects in mind that I had seen on decorating websites so I knew what I was looking for. I ended up scoring some great deals and getting to show off my artistic side without having to spend a ton of money. I love the way everything turned out.
