An uncertain global economy is causing fluctuating energy prices, is it time to claim energy independence through solar technology or is it an unnecessary cost during the economic downturn?

A barrel of oil, which reached an all time high, a drop of more than half, although it&#8217;s a dramatic drop it has been mirrored in many other fuels. However the average household energy bill, which increased by up to one third in the summer hike, is yet to see the benefit of the falling market. Ed Mayo (2009), chief executive of Consumer Focus, confirms, Energy companies all put their prices up arguing that it was down to rising cost of oil and gas, but now that is reversed, we are seeing delay, blather and procrastination.

This situation is particularly infuriating when placed in the context of a global recession. As consumer goods become more expensive and household incomes are slashed, cheaper energy could be a lifeline for families and businesses alike and would facilitate a speedier recovery from the downturn. Collusion between the big energy companies has also been questioned, with providers increasing costs at the same time and now delaying cuts together to ensure maximum profits.

With condemnation coming from all directions including the Prime Minister&#8217;s office and so little action it is clear that the industry regulators are ineffectual and the companies are free to hold the consumer to ransom.

It is easy to become frustrated when reading this information and it&#8217;s not hard to see why more and more people are taking control of their own energy needs by installing PV solar power technology.

Solar power isn&#8217;t a new technology, in fact it dates back to ancient times when the Greeks and the Chinese would design buildings that faced towards the south to provide optimum heat and light, however active harnessing of solar energy had its first significant application as a back-up power supply to the Vanguard I satellite in 1958 becoming a prototype for today&#8217;s residential solar panels. Throughout the 1960s the high cost of solar cells meant that terrestrial use was limited, however in the 1970s price levels made technology a feasible option for remote areas without grid access such as oil rigs and tele-com stations. The rising cost of fuel continued to drive the enhancement of the technology until the early 1980s when a falling oil price led to a reduction in funding, shifting leadership in the sector from the US to Germany and Japan.

Now that energy efficiency has been placed high on the agenda of many national governments, all sorts of initiatives are available for households and businesses willing to generate their own power. Across Europe many countries have long established tariffs allowing individuals to sell their surplus energy back to the grid, encouraging energy sustainability through financial incentives, dispelling one of the major drawbacks of solar, the installation cost.

The second drawback with this energy is that it requires greater efficiency on the part of individuals; in order to make the most out of solar power many recognize that by fitting energy saving light bulbs, using energy efficient appliances and turning electronic devices off standby can help to generate more excess power and thus more money. Your lifestyle need not be compromised &#8211; just made more efficient.

The idea of a major shift to solar technologies has always true that the technologies on offer today could not supply the major heavy industries, however by adopting more efficient technologies smaller businesses and households could be running on solar power, not only cutting their high-priced energy overheads but also making money selling the excess.
