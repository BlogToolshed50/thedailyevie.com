First impression have more power than you expect, especially when it comes to the job interview. A significant part of a hiring decision is not only your experience but also your appearance. The first judgment an interviewer makes is going to be based upon your appearance during a first meet. If you dressed professionally come to an interview , you will feel a confidence and others will sense your self-assurance as well. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always important to dress professionally for a job interview.

Don&#8217;t dress for a party or a date. The candidate dressed in a suit and tie would make a much better impression than the one dressed in a untidy t-shirt and jeans.
