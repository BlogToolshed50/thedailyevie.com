Written by my friend Betty Walls

I am a new convert to directv packages in Texas. I was one of those people who didn&#8217;t really care if she had a BlueRay player and didn&#8217;t see the need for high definition television. I frowned when people mentioned their new flat screen television with its five thousand channels. Things changed pretty rapidly when I started watching nature shows in HD. I&#8217;ve always loved the ocean discovery shows and I think the underwater camera work is really amazing. I actually got a contract with satellite television just to get the nature channels.

I sat down with a bowl of popcorn and my four-year-old son to enjoy an hour of Our Amazing Oceans and the high definition television was incredible. I could almost imagine being under the water with all of the colorful sea creatures. The bubbles on the television screen looked so real that I wanted to touch them. It was stunning to see coral in every shade of pink and purple imaginable on my television. The most amazing thing to see in HD was the fish. The individual scales glitter and shine like rainbows and the details that become visible with high definition television will change the way you look at the world.
