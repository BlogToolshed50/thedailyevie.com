Are you wondering about what you have to do with credit repair? Or maybe you’re just curious whether your credit needs fixing or not? Last time you checked, you didn’t but who knows what could happen in five years? Maybe, you already know that you do need credit repair but you’re unsure whether to do it yourself or pay for the services of a credit repair company? Or perhaps, you’re about to undergo a credit check to qualify for a career promotion and you’re hoping to make it absolutely sure that you’ll pass?

If so, here’s everything you have to know about credit repair.

Each step that you take in credit repair must be evaluated carefully. If you’re going to do it yourself, prepare beforehand by reading credit repair books, searching the Internet for advice from experts, purchasing a do-it-yourself credit repair kit and so on.

As you read, you’ll see that the first thing everyone shall advise you to do is to procure a copy of your credit report. If you were under the impression that only finance companies, banks and merchants can ask for a credit report, you’re wrong. As long as you’re asking for a credit report done on you, then certainly you can ask for a copy. This would cost you a bit so better prepare to spend. We advise you to take at least copies of your credit reports. The most financial institutions usually base their decisions on either of the credit reports provided by the aforementioned credit bureaus.

Got your copy now? Okay, roll it out and study each and every item in the list. Don’t overlook anything, even your personal records because you’re certainly not the only Lisa Smith in Washington, D.C. and who knows if the other Ms. Smith have unimaginable debts that were somehow mistakenly listed under your record? It pays to be cautious, okay. Now, with a do-it-yourself credit repair kit, they’re sure to advise you about the common things to watch out for. You’ll be surprised to know that approximately thirty percent of credit reports contain items. So who knows if you’re one of that thirty percent?

Lastly, if you find out anything to dispute, it’s time to fill up the form for disputes and then approaching the credit bureau responsible for the erroneous credit report. Take our advice and use time to your disadvantage. File for disputes during the busiest times of the year like the ones following Thanksgiving and Christmas.
