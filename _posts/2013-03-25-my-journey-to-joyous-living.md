Not long ago, I realized I was feeling less than joyous about my life, and about myself. I had no clue why &#8212; I lived where I wanted to, had the family I wanted close around me, and the job I&#8217;d gone to college to get&#8230; wait! Like millions of others, it was suddenly crystal clear that my discontent laid in my job! I’d worked for 22 years in a job I did not love. I thought that I had everything I wanted in life and yet the lack of passion for my job had left me with a terrible emptiness inside. I suddenly realized that what I wanted was not a “job” but a career, a life’s work . . . a direction that defined me and gave me room to grow.

From that point on, it was obvious to me that if the direction of my life needed some tweaking, all I had to do was center myself in a positive place, and tweak it! For me, the path to bringing joy and fulfillment back into my life was a gift from a friend, Susan Vandenberg, the most unlikely friend I can think of. It was just a matter of allowing myself to receive and embrace the opportunity she had to offer. Really, it was the same path that other independent home-based folks have taken for many years, at least as far back as my great grandparents. 

This form of distribution, skipping the middle-man takes the products and services directly from the company to the consumer. Advertising comes through word of mouth: friends sharing with their friends, sharing with their friends: concentric net-working among people. This type of home-based business enables regular people like you and me to be their own boss, create unlimited income, work with people you enjoy, retire early, free up time to do what you love doing; spend more time with your family, travel the world, pursue your dreams! Having no previous experience or education with any aspect of my new career, I now have the opportunity to impact thousands of lives! This is really working for me! And it can work for you!

The best part of all of this is the journey itself. It’s a journey of bravery, tolerance, and self-belief in the face of criticism. Along my pathway, I’m learning that I’m capable of accomplishing every dream and desire that ever came through my mind. It’s my life, and I’m finally living it that way!

I’m in the infancy of my journey, but I trust each step is taking me exactly where I want to be.

Are you wondering where that place is? It’s a place where my husband and I do not worry about money, and our hearts are full of love, trust and peace. We have no fears. No doubts. We have all the time in the world to spend with our family and friends, giving and sharing to our fullest potential. We live our values and teach by example.

The business is really just a stepping stone in getting to this place that I’ve envisioned, and intend with all my heart to create. When I’m uncomfortable, and at times I am, I recognize that growing pains are natural when you’re moving forward. I don’t feel ready, but I continue to move forward, taking off &#8212; never looking down – just in case I’m actually flying.
