Most nights I relax by curling up on the couch with my laptop open and my TV turned on. But it isn’t because I need the TV as background noise. I can’t stop myself from tweeting funny lines from “The Office” or my reaction to crazy plot twists on “Gossip Girl” while I’m watching Cable TV.

It seems that I’m not the only one that keeps occupied by using both the Internet and TV at the same time because the trending topics on any given night during primetime TV are competing show titles or lead characters on the show. I’ll tweet something about how much of a creep Chuck Bass from “Gossip Girl” is after the plot of his latest scheme is revealed to the audience or the latest ridiculous, misguided thing Michael Scot says on “The Office” to his employees. p>

Many of these times my friends will retweet what I wrote or respond to me about what they think will end up happening in a given show’s season finale. Sometimes strangers find my tweets by hash tags of the show I’ve added to tweets and tweet back at me agreeing with what I said! At first I was a little freaked out by this, but decided it’s cool to find things in common with strangers, even if it’s a mutual hatred for a fictional character.
