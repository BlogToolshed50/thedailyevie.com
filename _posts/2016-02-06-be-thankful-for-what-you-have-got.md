Did you know that the 911 equivalent in the UK (999) now has call waiting? I hope that you never find out for yourself.

Have you ever had to resuscitate someone? I sincerely hope that you haven’t. Have any of your family spent time in hospital? If they have, I hope it wasn’t for long.

Well, I have experienced all three of the above the following number of times in the last three years:

Held in a queue after dialing 999 &#8211; 4 times
  
Given resuscitation to my son &#8211; 6 times
  
Time spent at hospital bedside &#8211; at least 18 months

Oh, I almost forgot. We have also been told on no less than three occasions that it would be unlikely he would survive the next 24 hours

Am I bitter? No. In a way, I’m grateful for the experience. I wouldn’t be doing what I am doing now if it wasn’t for my son. All of my priorities have been turned around because of him. 

I could be one of those people who wallow in self-pity at how unlucky they are, or how unfair life is. I have chosen not to. I have chosen to take something positive out of the fact that my 3-year-old son is severely disabled, and will be for the rest of his life. I have quit my job to spend time looking after my family. I now spend more time with my wife, my son, and I can take my 6-year-old daughter to school every day. I have decided that life is there for living, and that money (although nice to have) shouldn’t be the prime motivator for working. 

I can also now appreciate how lucky I really am.

There are many families who have a ‘special’ child like ours, who is not as fortunate as my son. We are lucky that we have a healthy daughter. I am lucky that I have a wonderful wife. Being in this situation makes you appreciate the good things, instead of focusing on the bad things.

I envy families that can go on holiday together, who can play in the park together, or can go out for a meal together. The saddest thing is not what I haven’t got, it is those who have got what I want not even realizing the lucky hand they have been dealt in this game of life. Be thankful what you are able to do or be, and don’t dwell on those things that you wish for. If you could realize how lucky you are, then your life will improve dramatically, just like mine. Be grateful that you have a roof over your head, electricity, television, and running water. There are a lot of people in this world who have none of these and end up becoming more successful than you or I. 

If you can show gratitude for what you have, and use your energy towards attaining what you don’t have, then you are on the first rung on the ladder to success.
