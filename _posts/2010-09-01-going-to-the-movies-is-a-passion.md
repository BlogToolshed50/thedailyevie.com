There is a Movie station on our cable that has old movies, but once in a while everyone needs to see the action on a big screen and get out of the house. This is what my wife and I do a couple of times a week. We love the classics and try to see the ones not often shown on cable. The world is left behind for a few hours.

We used to worry about leaving the home unattended, but since we got our reasonably price home security alarm system (More Info), all is well. Our minds can now be devoted to discussing and viewing the classic Movies with no other worries.

Recently we have seen a movie called Huk, set in the Philippines circa 1901 during the insurrection there. We loved seeing it again after so many years. Too bad there are not many Movie theaters that specialize in older film classics. It is a shame because the younger generation is missing out in fine acting and camera angles not used today with all the computerized equipment. We are now planning our next outing.
