Guest blog post by Corey Taylor

One of my favorite spring sports to watch is basketball. I love to record the games on my Directtv and watch them when I have free time.

One thing I love about the sport is that it&#8217;s so fast-paced. It&#8217;s exhilarating. I love watching the guys run and jump.

March Madness is my favorite basketball tournament. Every year, I fill out my bracket in March. Picking the Final Four is nearly impossible, and I never win, but it&#8217;s still fun to speculate. Every year, there&#8217;s a Cinderella team. A Cinderella team is like a little engine that could. They excel, even though the odds are against them.

By early April, the tournament is over and college basketball crowns the new national champions. My favorite team is the Duke Blue Devils. They&#8217;ve won many championships in the school&#8217;s history. Coach K is a legend, and he&#8217;s coached some excellent players.

They NBA finals are also held every spring. As soon as March Madness is over, I tune in to professional basketball. I don&#8217;t have a favorite team anymore. As I kid, I loved the Bulls and the Celtics. Sometimes I watch the games with my brother. He&#8217;s even more of a fanatic than I am.
