I really love the commercials for Ocean Spray. I have always been insanely amused by the commercials that Ocean Spray has come up with. I gotta say that I really hate the juice and I prefer to drink a different brand of cranberry juice but I would almost buy a case of Ocean Spray just because the commercials that they make never cease to blow me away. First of all, I love how the guys are always wading in a bog. Bogs mystify me because I have never actually seen a cranberry bog nor will I ever. I think it is an interesting concept to go wading through a bog and then I get to see it on television. It&#8217;s really lovely to see all of those bright red cranberries just floating in the water. I usually connect guys in thigh high boots with fishing and the Lower East Side but to see them wading through the water with little red berries is truly beautiful. First the cranberries are in the water then they are in your sauce on Thanksgiving, the concept of a bog is really just excites me! The Ocean Spray commercials I catch on my satellite tv in spanish really delight my senses and make me want a glass of Ocean Spray even though it is really a bit too tart for my taste.
