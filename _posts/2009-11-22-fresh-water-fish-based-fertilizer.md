I recently come across a news item where in, the information on fresh water fish was something different. I was under the impression that they are predominantly used as the food item. But the article indicates that these are used as the best source of organic fertilizers in the field of agriculture.

Fresh water fish is said to contain the three vital nutrients viz., Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Pottassium which are normally supplemented for the crop growth. Many of the leading companies engaged in the production of such nutrient rich organic fertilizers process the fresh water fish at a low temperature of 90 degrees F to preserve the naturally occurring vitamins, amino acids and various other useful enzymes. There after it is stored in the digestion tanks to get the end product called the &#8220;Hydrolysate&#8221;.

The Hydrolysate contains all the natural beneficial oils and various proteins that are normally available in the fresh water fish without any dilution. This is a bio active substance which breaks down very slowly and the nutrients are made available to the plants over a longer period.

This fresh water fish based fertilizer is found in the form of emulsions and sold in the market. In the days ahead, it is advisable that farmers are educated on these aspects of organic farming to ensure the production of the food materials without any toxicity.
