Population of the world is reaching a level of more than 600 billion and it is increasing in a greater speed than predicted. Consumption of energy on account of various utilities by the human race too is on the increase. Though Mother nature is capable of providing the need of the human race, the greed to grow fast has resulted in exploitation of the available energy sources beyond a limit, leading to the shortage.

As of now the demand for petroleum products vividly demonstrates this aspect and the various consequences faced by many countries. Hence, conservation of available energy sources is imperative, if the future generation is to lead a peaceful and moderate life. Everyone can apply his mind the way in which he or she can contribute to the man-kind in the matter of conserving the available energy without wasting it.
