Elderly Care has become the topic of greater importance in most of the countries and especially in western nations. Caregivers to the elderly people are on the rise, but the requisite attention is not forthcoming due to paucity of such caregivers. To assist the old people various institutions are doing the research to create the robots to take care of the job. At University of Texas efforts are going on to design the technology that will allow the tomorrow&#8217;s seniors to remain independent longer than previous generation. Sensors embedded in the senior&#8217;s home will help for monitoring them closely.
