Since the late nineteen century and the rise of scientific management, organizations have been specifically designed with the objective of trying to control emotions. A well-run organization was one that successfully eliminated frustration, fear, anger, love, hate, joy, grief, and similar feelings. Such emotions were the antithesis of rationality. Certainly some emotions, particularly when exhibited at the wrong time, can reduce employee performance. But this doesn&#8217;t change the reality that employees bring an emotional component with them to work everyday.

What Are Emotions?
  
Although we donâ€™t want to obsess on definitions, before we can proceed with out analysis, we need to clarify three terms that are closely intertwined. These are affect, emotions, and moods.
  
Affect is generic term that covers a broad range of feelings that people experience. It&#8217;s an umbrella concept encompasses both emotions and moods. Emotions are intense feelings that are directed at someone or something. Finally moods are feelings that tend to be less intense than emotions and that lack a contextual stimulus.
  
Emotions are reactions to an object, not a trait. They are object specific. You show your emotions when you&#8217;re &#8220;happy about something, angry at some one, afraid of something.&#8221; Moods, on the other hand, aren&#8217;t directed at object. Emotions can tend into moods when you lose focus on the contextual object. So when a work colleague criticizes you for the way you spoke to a client, you might become angry at him. That is, you show emotion (anger) toward a specific object become angry at him. But later in the day, you might find yourself just generally dispirited. You can&#8217;t attribute this feeling to any single event; you&#8217;re just not your normal, upbeat self. This effective state describes a mood.
  
A related term that is gaining increasing importance in management is emotional labor. Every employee expends physical and mental labor when they put their bodies and cognitive capabilities, respectively into their job. But most jobs also require emotional labor. This is when an employee, express organizationally desired emotions during interpersonal transactions.

Felt Versus Displayed Emotions
  
Emotional labor creates dilemmas for employees when their job requires them to exhibit emotions that are incongruous with their actual feelings. Not surprisingly, this is a frequent occurrence. There are people at work with whom you find it very difficult to be friendly. May be you consider their personality abrasive. Maybe you know they have said negative things about you behind your back. Regardless your job requires you to interact with these people on a regular basis. So you are forced to feign friendliness.
  
It can help you to better understand emotions if you separate them into felt versus displayed. Felt emotions are individual actual emotions. In contrast, displayed emotions are those there organizationally required and considered appropriate in a given job.
