Yesterday I went out for one of the best Italian dinners that I have had in quite a long time. This is saying quite a lot, considering that there are more than eight Italian restaurants within five miles of my home.

When I left home, I wasn&#8217;t sure where I wanted to go to eat. I fed the cats, set my ADT security alarm, and left towards the highway. I was thinking of going to one of the chains nearby, when I noticed Piccolo&#8217;s was in a strip center that I pass every single day on the way to work. I had never noticed it before because it was kind of hidden behind the shrubs when I looked from the street. I decided to eat there.

The first thing that I can say is that the wait service was wonderful. There are two sides to the restaurant, a &#8220;slices&#8221; half and a sit down half, and I was not ready for a sit down meal so I just went to the other side, which is definitely more casual. However, I was still promptly greeted by a server and given all of the attention that I would expect from the sit down side of the restaurant.

The food, to say the least, was incredible. All I ordered was a calzone, but this was one of the best calzones that I have ever had. The cheese (according to the server at least) was completely organic and the crust handmade. In fact, I saw them tossing it and that was impressive. I will definitely return to this restaurant.
