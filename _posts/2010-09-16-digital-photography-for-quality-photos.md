You can also crop the photo and design your own photo. All of these in one photo editing package. It&#8217;s more than what you can get from film cameras. 

If you want to put up a small business, then digital photography would be of great help. Let your creativity works. Digital photos cannot just be simple photos. Now, you can turn them into T-shirts, mugs, invitations, greeting cards, calendars and a lot more. This is for the fact that digital photos can be printed anywhere and in anyway. Just make use of the right photo paper, and surely, you can make lots of money from it.

Lastly, digital photography has the ability to share the photos you have you&#8217;re your love ones and relatives. You can simply give a copy of the precious moments to someone everywhere.
