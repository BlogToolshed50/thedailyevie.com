Resolutions are nothing but setting goals for your self, which is anyway the secret to success. But keep in mind not to set unachievable/steep goals that is not within reach. Set short-term goals and go for them. You could look into some of these resolutions or maybe go for all of them! And why not?

Enhance your skills: Add a professional degree to your CV. Or take a class or go to a seminar. It is essential to set learning goals on a regular basis. As the saying goes, ‘If you’re not green and growing, you’re ripe and rotting.’

Learn new technology: The most happening thing in this age is technology which is here to stay. Communication is essential for business success. Take stock of where you’re the weakest and change that.

Be prepared with your CV: In this day and time, you never know when opportunity might knock at your door. And it could be from outside of — or within — your company. So just be prepared to take up the challenge as and when it comes.

Learn a new language: This is particularly important if your work puts you in contact on a regular basis with people who speak another language. There are so many regional languages in your own country that you could learn or maybe go for a foreign language course. It will help you in the long run.

Clean out old files, e-mails: Cleaning up old files is a great way to revisit priorities and gain perspective on what’s really important. Not only will it give you a fresh start to the year ahead, but if you pay careful attention to what you keep and what you toss it may help you manage your workload more effectively in the future. When it comes to technology, Holland warns not to succumb to ads touting the newest techno-trend, instead know yourself and choose tools that match your personality.

Network with four people a month: This networking could be a great way to expand your knowledge base. Once you’ve identified what you have to learn in those areas, determine the people who will help you realize those goals and meet with them accordingly.

Read best-selling business books: Imagine the impact you can make if you are well-versed on business trends, even if it’s nothing more than to find your way to a healthy debate with others.

Find quality time for self/family: Look for ways to integrate both aspects of your life. Let family join you on a business trip, leave the office early on an afternoon to attend your child’s sporting event, or share family reading time by catching up on the best seller on business while sitting next to your children or spouse.

Increase your saving habit: Saving for retirement is critically important. Simply commit to yourself to take that next pay increase and put in more money into a saving scheme. Making this part of your career goals will give you peace of mind that you’re building toward a more comfortable retirement.

Exercise and eat healthy: With opportunities galore, find ways to exercise with your family. Pay attention to what you’re eating. Take time to reflect on what activities invigorate you and commit more time to doing them.
