Guest post written by my buddy Bernardo Graham

Like many people in the United States of America, I have children. Children love to be involved in sports at school, no matter what kind. I have a son who greatly enjoys going to his fall wrestling meets because he is bigger and stronger than most of the kids his age. He says that he likes that fact that he can be active in his school doing something he enjoys. He gets straight A&#8217;s and I love that he can be so productive. He makes time for his family when he isn&#8217;t at school, and makes times for friends as well. All in all, I love the fact that he is happy. Nothing is better than seeing your children succeed.

When I was in school I never participated in after school programs. I didn&#8217;t think they were worth my time or energy, and I had more important things to do. My son knew this and I believe that he became heavily involved in after school programs to show me that they are good to do, and are not worthless. He loves coming home and telling me about what happened at his meets, and tournaments. Last week I decided that I was going to see one for myself. I set my adt security in Iowa right before I left, and went off to his meet. It was the best thing in the world to see my child beat everybody else with no problem!
