Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition in which the body&#8217;s temperature rises far above normal. The body&#8217;s temperature control mechanism fails, sweating may stop and the body temperature rises rapidly. When you notice rapid pulse, noisy breathing, convulsions or vomiting and hot, flushed skin, give first aid for heatstroke.

1. Check the casualty for symptoms of heatstroke. Lowering the body temperature is the most urgent first aid for heatstroke.
     
2. Move the casualty to a cool, shaded place or indoors if possible. Call for medical help.
     
3. Cool the casualty by removing clothing, covering with a wet sheet, immersing in cool water or sponging with cool water, especially in the armpits, neck and groin areas.
     
4. When the body feels cool to the touch, cover the casualty with a dry sheet. If temperature begins to rise again, repeat step three.
     
5. Continue to monitor the casualty until medical help is available.
