Tsunami, the most dreaded word that many of us cannot forget. I only wonder about the mighty power of the &#8220;Force Nature&#8221; which can mar the things beyond the imagination of the human being. One can never forget Dec 26th 2004 when the tragedy took the world un expected. The Tsunami that followed the earth quake in the Asian region killed not less than 226,000 people on a single day. There was no warning, but the people had to face the wrath of mother nature without time for any preparation to meet the challenge.

Indonesia was the worst hit country out of the 13 countries with the death toll and missing numbers reaching a whooping 166,000. The fury of the Tsunami was so terrific that a boat with 100 people were lifted to the roof top of the two storied building.

It is a matter of concern that frequent earth quakes are occurring in the Indian ocean areas in around Indonesia, Pholipines, etc., causing lots of hardships to the people. Recently I read in the newspaper that an earthquake with the magnitude of 6.00 had struck the Indonesia leading to the Tsunami warning.

The havoc that is still green in the memory of many residents deter them to dream of a house near the seashore. Though each one of us realized that such natural disaster is the result of the over exploitation of the natural wealth and indiscriminate usage for material growth, we are yet to enter the corrective phase. It is high time that our energy is diverted to preserve this earth and the human being by dealing with the nature in a benign manner.
