I have recently finished the new Starz mini-series Spartacus: Blood and Sand. Despite the many doubts that the pilot episode left me with, the show took an immediate and surprising turn for the better by the second episode. Though many would argue that the show is nothing more than over-the-top blood, and violence (and I can&#8217;t argue that is does feature those in spades), they all seem to overlook the deep emotional development of each of the characters, as well as their rich backgrounds that motivate them and drive the plot forward.

The show follows the rise of Spartacus as a gladiator, from the details of his capture all the way until the start of his infamous rebellion. While the historical details may be smudged for entertainment&#8217;s sake, the show maintains its integrity by offering intense, adrenaline packed, jaw-clenching fight scenes, and great acting on top of it all.

Is it over the top at times? Yes. But it never fails to deliver, and is one of the only shows that I&#8217;ve ever actually been excited in anticipation of the next episode. Week by week I would tune in to watch the show on the premium channels I get through Illinois DIRECTTV Deals every Friday night. To date it is one of the only shows that I didn&#8217;t simply record to be watched later.
