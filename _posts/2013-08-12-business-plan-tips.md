Writing a business plan is not easy. It takes a lot of time and hard work. Here are some general tips that can help you through it.

First, make a list of your new company&#8217;s strengths, its weaknesses, the market threats and opportunities. Keep your plan short and to the point; no more than 20 pages or so. Then nail down your assumptions. Be realistic about your projections and base your assumptions on your market research and analysis.

Next, make a list of your business risks. Be honest with yourself. Every business has competition. Who are they and how will they impact your business. List other risks like potential changes in your market, personnel challenges, and technology risks. This shows that you&#8217;ve given thought to both the upside and downside of your business.

Don&#8217;t make statements you can&#8217;t support. A good business is not built on wishful thinking. Back up your claims with research and analysis. Also, don&#8217;t use highly technical terms. Keep the wording simple or if you must use technical terms, explain them fully in your plan.

Finally, a business plan is never finished. It&#8217;s a living document that should be updated frequently as you move through your plan. You&#8217;ll be surprised how many times you&#8217;ll modify your activities when new market opportunities present themselves.
